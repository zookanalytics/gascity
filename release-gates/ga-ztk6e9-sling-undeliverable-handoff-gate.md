| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Review PASS present | **PASS** | `ga-3ejr8r` is closed with reason `pass` and records reviewed commit `ad7fe8f245aa9363c3f396eb0b8a3dc2daba956a`; no review carryover is involved. |
| 2 | Acceptance criteria met | **PASS** | The assigned-parent/default-formula conflict now emits a distinct warning naming the blocking assignee and the undeliverable target state. The unassigned control still auto-burns the stale molecule and attaches normally. `TestDefaultFormulaFallbackOnAssignedBeadIsSilentlyUndeliverable`, `TestDefaultFormulaFallbackControlUnassignedBeadAttaches`, `TestOnFormulaExistingMoleculeErrors`, and `TestCheckNoMoleculeChildrenConvoyLookupDoesNotShadowV1Children` each passed twice in the full union, with 0 FAIL and 0 SKIP. |
| 3 | Tests pass | **PASS with two attributed raw failures** | The documented full local CI union scheduled all 40 jobs: **38 PASS / 2 raw FAIL / 0 omitted**, comprising **48,717 PASS / 2 raw FAIL / 227 SKIP** top-level executions. Both diff-owned tests ran twice and passed twice: **4 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 SKIP**. The two raw failures stopped during unrelated fixture `gc init` before workflow or sling execution and satisfy criterion 3a below. `test_cmd_scope: full-suite`; `waiver_ref: none`; `ci_lane_run: n/a (no CI-config change)`. |
| 4 | No high-severity review findings open | **PASS** | Review bead `ga-3ejr8r` records no style, security, or specification finding requiring changes; unresolved HIGH count is 0. |
| 5 | Final branch is clean | **PASS** | Before writing this gate record, `git status --short` was empty at the exact reviewed SHA. `gofmt -l` on both changed Go files and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` produced no output. |
| 6 | Branch diverges cleanly from main | **PASS** | `git merge-tree --write-tree --messages origin/main ad7fe8f245aa9363c3f396eb0b8a3dc2daba956a` exited 0 against `origin/main@af8844ad697961e6f9d0503b5a001fbb9adfc0cb`, producing tree `a854381f375c2aafe438f77160eab684e4856530`; no bounded self-rebase was needed. The already-merged preflight found no PR carrying the reviewed SHA. |
| 7 | Single feature theme | **PASS** | The two-commit delta touches only `internal/sling/sling_core.go` and its `cmd/gc` regression test. Both changes address the same default-formula hand-off observability defect; there is no independent feature theme. |

## Criterion 3a attribution

Both failures map to the open condition tracker `ga-lejnse`, created 2026-09-13 before this run. The tracker already names both tests and this exact random-cursor shared-server migration-refusal signature. This run's sighting was appended and read back as comment `b035ad6d-84bb-5694-aa69-66a526d77a1e`.

- `TestAdoptPRFormulaCompileAndRun -> ga-lejnse | clause 1: test/integration/review_formula_test.go is not diff-owned | clause 2: predating open tracker inspected and updated | clause 3(a): setupReviewFormulaCity failed inside initCityWithManagedDoltRecovery when external bd refused 58 pending shared-server migrations (v8 -> v66), before startReviewWorkflow and before changed attachFormulaToBead could execute | clause 4: failing test package test/integration has no path overlap with internal/sling/sling_core.go or cmd/gc/cmd_sling_undeliverable_test.go`
- `TestAdoptPRFormulaRetriesTransientReviewerStep -> ga-lejnse | clause 1: test/integration/review_formula_test.go is not diff-owned | clause 2: predating open tracker inspected and updated | clause 3(a): setupReviewFormulaCity failed inside initCityWithManagedDoltRecovery when external bd refused 11 pending shared-server migrations (v55 -> v66), before startReviewWorkflow and before changed attachFormulaToBead could execute | clause 4: failing test package test/integration has no path overlap with internal/sling/sling_core.go or cmd/gc/cmd_sling_undeliverable_test.go`

No retry was used to turn either failure green. The first-run results remain preserved and attributed under the non-diff-owned gate-failure protocol.

## Maintainer follow-up

Applied on top of the reviewed source at `8e23dd297` (the gate commit merged
with `origin/main`) during PR #6449 integration. The criteria table above is
unchanged: both findings are integration defects in the new warning, not
regressions in the behavior the table certifies.

1. **Routing identity.** The guard compared `holder.Assignee` against
   `a.QualifiedName()`, but every writer and reader of `gc.routed_to` derives
   its identity through `agentutil.RoutedToIdentity` — which collapses a pool
   instance to its pool name — and a pool session claims work as
   `"<pool>-<session id>"`. A bead legitimately held by the target pool's own
   session therefore drew a spurious "undeliverable" warning. The comparison
   now goes through `RoutedToIdentity` plus the same `claimedByOwnPoolSession`
   prefix carve-out `CheckBeadState` already makes
   (`internal/sling/sling_attachment.go`).
2. **graph.v2 parity.** The graph.v2 default-formula fallback in
   `attachFormulaToBead` strands the bead identically and emitted only the
   molecule-conflict warning. Both branches now call the shared
   `undeliverableHandoffWarning` helper.

Each fix is pinned by a test that fails without it:
`TestDefaultFormulaFallbackPoolSessionClaimIsNotUndeliverable`
(`cmd/gc/cmd_sling_undeliverable_test.go`) and the undeliverable assertion
added to
`TestDoSlingDefaultFormulaFallsBackToPlainRouteWhenMoleculeAttachedGraphV2Formula`
(`internal/sling/sling_core_test.go`); the legacy-branch test carries the
mirrored assertion so neither branch can silently drop the warning.

Re-run evidence:

- `go build ./...` — PASS
- `go vet ./...` — PASS
- `gofmt -l` on the three changed files — no output
- `go test ./internal/sling/... -run 'DefaultFormula|AttachFormula|CheckBeadState' -count=2` — PASS
- `go test ./internal/sling/... -count=1` — PASS
- `go test ./cmd/gc/ -run 'DefaultFormulaFallback|TestOnFormulaExistingMolecule' -count=2` — PASS (4 tests x2, 0 FAIL)
- `go test ./internal/agentutil/ -run 'RoutedToIdentity' -count=1` — PASS
- `make test-ci-policy` — PASS
- `GC_FAST_UNIT=0 GO_TEST_COUNT=1 ./scripts/test-go-test-shard ./cmd/gc 4 12` — PASS, exit 0, 0 FAIL. This is the shard that was red in CI on the reviewed SHA; `TestCityRuntimeTick_RefreshesManualSessionOverlayAfterSync` (a `TempDir` cleanup race unrelated to this diff) passed on re-run.
