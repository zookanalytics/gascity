# Run a NativeLink remote-execution worker on a Blacksmith runner for the life of
# this workflow run's Bazel job, then drain and exit.
#
# Blacksmith donates this compute for OSS-project work only. The worker
# registers with rbe-west's OSS scheduler (clients reach it with
# --remote_instance_name=oss): OSS CI, plus allowlisted maintainers building
# OSS code with an operator-issued client certificate. Other developer and
# agent builds use the default instance and never run here. The OSS and
# default instances share one CAS,
# but rbe-west splits the action cache: results written here go to the "oss"
# action cache, which fork PRs read anonymously and the default instance
# reads through (never writes). So REMOTE_AC must say "oss", and so must the
# CAS stores: rbe-west's :443 confines this certificate to listeners that
# know instance "oss" alone (infra README "OSS worker certificate confined",
# FU2), where "" is 'instance_name' not configured. The fork tier says
# oss-fork, never "".
#
# Env (from the workflow):
#   RBE_WORKER_TLS_CERT / RBE_WORKER_TLS_KEY  base64 PEM, CN=rbe-oss-worker
#   RBE_WEST_HOST       e.g. rbe-west.ops.gascity.com (from a secret; not in git)
#   RBE_WEST_PORT       443 (default); 8444 for WORKER_TIER=fork
#   WORKER_TIER         oss (default): rbe-west's OSS scheduler, results cached in
#                       AC_OSS (REMOTE_AC). fork: the fork scheduler (rbe-fork,
#                       instance oss-fork; infra README "rbe-fork"): untrusted fork
#                       PR actions, nothing cached (no REMOTE_AC, upload strategy
#                       never), isolation mandatory (RBE_ACTION_ISOLATION must be
#                       1), every action in its own network namespace with
#                       loopback only (NETNS=1), and no user namespaces on the
#                       VM (user.max_user_namespaces=0). Its certificate
#                       (CN=rbe-fork-worker,OU=rbe-fork,O=gascity, fork CA) reaches
#                       nothing but the fork scheduler and the CAS.
#   WORKER_NAME         unique per worker
#   WORKER_MODE         run  (default): serve until BAZEL_JOB_NAME in this run completes
#                                       (needs GH_TOKEN with actions:read)
#                       pool: serve the shared OSS queue; retire after POOL_IDLE_MINUTES
#                             with nothing in flight, or at POOL_MAX_MINUTES
#                       measure: provision and measure this host, check it against
#                             the pin (tools/rbe/worker-env-drift check) and exit;
#                             no certificate, no worker (the canary, and the
#                             bazel job for changes to the worker host)
#   CACHE_DIR           optional (Blacksmith sticky disk): keeps the worker's local
#                       CAS warm across runs. Another VM wrote it, so every blob is
#                       re-hashed against its name before NativeLink loads it
#                       (scrub_cas), and the CAS is capped at CAS_MAX_BYTES.
#   CAS_MAX_BYTES       local CAS cap (default 150 GB; 60 GB on a sticky disk)
#   RBE_WIRE_ZSTD       1: fetches of blobs of 64 KiB or more travel as REAPI
#                       compressed-blobs/zstd (NativeLink 1.7.1 GrpcStore
#                       experimental_remote_cache_compression), for both tiers;
#                       uploads stay identity (no writable rbe-west listener
#                       accepts zstd). The remote CAS is split: REMOTE_READ
#                       (zstd, RBE_WIRE_ZSTD_READ_URL) and REMOTE_WRITE
#                       (identity, the worker's own endpoint). Needs
#                       RBE_WIRE_ZSTD_READ_URL set to the dedicated zread
#                       host below, else every such fetch fails with
#                       InvalidArgument (there is no identity fallback). 0
#                       (default): identity through one REMOTE_CAS, as before.
#   RBE_WIRE_ZSTD_READ_URL  where REMOTE_READ fetches when RBE_WIRE_ZSTD=1.
#                       The farm serves zstd reads only on dedicated zread
#                       hostnames, never the worker's own endpoint: OSS
#                       grpcs://rbe-zread.ops.gascity.com:443, fork
#                       grpcs://rbe-fork-zread.ops.gascity.com:8444 (the
#                       normal hosts return InvalidArgument for compressed
#                       reads). Required when RBE_WIRE_ZSTD=1; the worker
#                       exits 2 instead of registering if this is empty or
#                       equal to its own grpcs://RBE_WEST_HOST:RBE_WEST_PORT.
#                       Rollback: set RBE_WIRE_ZSTD (RBE_FORK_WIRE_ZSTD for
#                       the fork pool) to 0; for an emergency rollback cancel
#                       the pool runs, since an in-flight worker keeps its
#                       store (and this switch) until it retires.
#   RBE_ACTION_ISOLATION  1 (default): every action runs as a per-action slot
#                       user in private namespaces (below). 0: the rollback
#                       switch, actions run as this runner user as before.
#                       canary: workers of one run in RBE_ACTION_CANARY_EVERY
#                       (default 4; GITHUB_RUN_ID % N == 0) try isolation and
#                       fall back to 0 instead of exiting when it fails; the
