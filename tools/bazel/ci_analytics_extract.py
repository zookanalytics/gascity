"""Build a redacted `ci-analytics-summary` v1 JSON from a lane's Bazel outputs.

Design: rbe-ci-bep-analytics-design.md, section 3. This file is a byte copy
across gascity and beads (tools/bazel/ci_analytics_extract.py in both):
stdlib Python 3.12+, like critpath.py.

Inputs, per `--invocation STEP BEP [EXEC_LOG|-] [PROFILE|-]` (repeatable, at
most 8):

  - BEP JSON (`--build_event_json_file`): required. Timing, runner counts,
    test results and summaries, network bytes.
  - the compact execution log (`--execution_log_compact_file`, zstd-framed
    protobuf): per-spawn mnemonic, runner, cache hit, target, SpawnMetrics.
    "-" skips it (no per-mnemonic or per-cold data for that invocation).
  - the JSON profile (`--profile`): "Fetching repository" wall time per
    external repository. "-" skips it.

Redaction is by construction (never read, by omission), by validation (every
emitted string is regex-checked against a whitelist and against the tripwire
individually, so one hostile value is dropped rather than losing the whole
document), and by a final tripwire regex over the serialized output as a
backstop. See REDACTION in this file's comments at each site, and the
design's section 3.4.

Every line of BEP or exec log input is adversarial-input tolerant: a
malformed middle BEP line still drops the invocation (unchanged contract),
but a malformed individual event, protobuf entry or field degrades --
skipping just that event/entry/field -- rather than crashing the process.
See ParseTimeout and the try/except boundaries around the exec-log and BEP
passes in build_invocation().

Exit codes: 0 written | 3 no BEP for any invocation (nothing written) |
4 tripwire (nothing written).

Per-invocation `exec_log`/`profile` status values, for the S4 collector:
  - "ok": present, readable, and parsed (possibly with individually
    dropped/degraded entries -- that alone does not change this status).
  - "missing": "-" was passed for that input; it was never read.
  - "unreadable": the path couldn't be opened (missing file, permissions).
  - "corrupt": opened, but the content was unparseable as a whole, or (for
    the profile) a non-finite ts/dur value was seen and dropped.
  - "timeout": PARSE_DEADLINE_S was exceeded partway through parsing; any
    entries already parsed are kept.
  - "too_large": the input exceeded MAX_EXEC_LOG_BYTES after decompression.
