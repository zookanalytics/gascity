	// Bumped for the beads-topology-acceptance job: the bd/dolt-backed topology
	// shapes had never executed in CI — every job lacked a bd with
	// --proxied-server, so each test skipped and a suite that ran nothing
	// reported green. The new job builds bd from BD_CURRENT_REF and sets
	// GC_REQUIRE_ACCEPTANCE_TOOLING so a runner without that bd fails instead.
	//
	// Bumped again to widen that job's beads_topology path filter. The curated
	// cmd/gc globs matched none of the files the proxied lifecycle actually lives
	// in — the ownership journal, the provider lifecycle, the bd env plumbing,
	// the `gc init` transport flags — so a change to the feature skipped its own
	// acceptance job and ci-required still went green on the allowed skip. The
	// filter is now cmd/gc/**, internal/beads/**, internal/doctor/**,
	// examples/bd/**, test/acceptance/** plus the pins and the workflow.
	//
	// Bumped again on the merge with main, which carried its own reviewed delta
	// (Beads v1.3.0-rc.2 -> v1.3.0): the merged workflow holds both changes, so
	// neither side's digest describes it.
	//
	// Bumped again to widen beads_topology's internal/ globs to internal/**.
	// The curated list repeated the same mistake one directory out: the Dolt
	// floor (internal/doltversion), the proxied provider's auth scope
	// (internal/doltauth), the pack state dir handed to the bd script
	// (internal/citylayout) and the pool/binding/health packages matched
	// neither beads_topology nor shared, so a change to any of them skipped the
	// only job that stands up the proxied shapes and ci-required accepted the
	// skip. `go list -deps ./test/acceptance/... ./cmd/gc` names 139 of 166
	// internal packages, so the filter is now the graph itself.
	//
	// Bumped again for one added step in the same job: "Proxied-native
	// lifecycle and safety" (council pr2 C-F1). TestProxiedNativeLifecycle and
	// TestProxiedNativeSafety carry //go:build acceptance_a and were selected
	// by no -run expression in any job, so the proxied-native lane's whole
	// evidence base — the per-crash-shape ping/recover budgets, foreign-root's
	// "0 pings, 0 dolt stop", the no-spawn positive control, both no-migrate
	// rows and the author-at-commit pin — was a local one-off no regression
	// could fail. Reviewed delta: one `go test` step, same job, same tooling,
	// no new trigger and no new permission.
	//
	// Bumped again to split that step into its own job (round3 D-F17). The
	// topology job's four step -timeouts summed to 115 minutes against its own
	// 90-minute cap, so a slow-but-live run was canceled by the job timeout
	// and lost its `--- FAIL` line and tee'd log. Reviewed delta: the topology
	// job's -timeouts become 30/15/30 (75 under 90); the lifecycle and safety
	// step moves to a new "Beads / proxied-native acceptance" job with the same
	// needs, the same beads_topology `if`, the same runner, env, bd build and
	// verify steps, one -timeout 45m test step under timeout-minutes 60, and a
	// skip summary; ci-required needs the new job and allows its skip exactly
	// as it does the topology job's. No new trigger and no new permission.
	// Merged with main's reviewed delta: cmd-gc-productmetrics-testhook
	// timeout-minutes 5 -> 12 (#6396: canceled at the 5-minute budget with no
	// failing test).
	//
	// Bumped again (#6385): the integration path filter also matches
	// internal/bootstrap/packs/core/assets/scripts/** so a reaper.sh-only
	// change runs the real-Dolt reaper tests. Reviewed delta: one filter path,
	// no new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (F9): beads-topology-acceptance gains one step running
	// TestBeadsProxiedIgnoresUserLevelSharedServer (-timeout 15m) and its job
	// cap moves 90 -> 105 minutes to keep the step budget under it. Reviewed
	// delta: one test step and the cap, no new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again for the Beads v1.3.0 -> v1.3.1-rc.2 -> v1.3.1 pins: every job's
	// BD_VERSION env value moves to the new tag. Reviewed delta: that value
	// only, no new job, step, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-nr9epw, restoring ga-1037rg / ga-yoxtux regression
	// coverage without re-widening test-bd-cli-contract's own -run regex,
	// which TestAcceptanceTargetsSeparateTierAFromExternalBdContracts pins as
	// an exact literal substring): one new step, "bd CLI contract HOME
	// isolation (...)", added immediately after the existing "bd CLI contract
	// (...)" step in each of contract-acceptance-previous, contract-
	// acceptance-current and contract-radar-bd-head. Each new step runs `make
	// test-bd-cli-contract-home-isolation`, a separate Makefile target driving
	// only TestRunBDIsolatesHOMEFromSharedServerConfig under the same
	// acceptance_bd_contract tag and bd binary the preceding step already
	// resolved onto PATH. No new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (rbe-west plan R2 step 1): the runner-policy job's own
	// runs-on drops its hard-coded login list for blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404,
	// matching runner_policy.py, which now selects Blacksmith for every event
	// and author. Reviewed delta: that one runs-on value, no new job, step,
	// trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again for the Dolt 2.1.7 -> 2.2.0 pin (the Dolt beads v1.3.1
	// qualifies): the job DOLT_VERSION env values only.
	//
	// Bumped again (keep managed Dolt logs from failed acceptance tests):
	// beads-topology-acceptance and beads-proxied-native-acceptance each gain
	// a step exporting GC_TEST_FAILURE_ARTIFACT_DIR to $GITHUB_ENV and an
	// `if: failure()` pinned upload-artifact step for that directory. No new
	// job, trigger, permission or secret.
	//
	// Bumped again (beads#7037): the topology job's shared-server step -run
	// also selects TestBlockedRepairOnProxiedCityAndRig, the proxied city+rig
	// proof of gc start's is_blocked repair (about 4 minutes, inside that
	// step's 15m -timeout). Reviewed delta: one -run alternative, no new job,
	// step, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (Go module fetch resilience): every job that calls
	// actions/setup-go directly sets its `cache: false` and gains one step
	// right after it, `uses: ./.github/actions/go-mod-download` (restore the
	// go.sum-keyed module download cache, run a retried `go mod download`,
	// save on push/schedule only), so build and test steps never fetch from
	// proxy.golang.org; and the shared changes filter gains that action's
	// directory and its retry script. Reviewed delta: one setup-go input and
	// one local-action step per setup-go job, two filter paths. No new job,
	// trigger, permission or secret. Then the shared changes filter gains
	// .github/scripts/go-mod-verify-cache.sh, the action's go.sum
	// verification step. Reviewed delta: one filter path.
	//
	// Bumped again (gc 1.5.1 proxied idle timeout): the proxied-native job's
	// test step also selects TestProxiedIdleTimeoutReapAndTransparentRestart,
	// sets GC_ACCEPTANCE_TOPOLOGY_MATRIX=1 for that step (the row is gated off
	// Tier A by that switch), and the step is renamed to say so. No new job,
	// trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (gc 1.5.1 suspension quiescence): the same step also
	// selects TestProxiedSuspensionIsQuiescence (~8 minutes, inside the step's
	// 45m -timeout) and its name says so. No new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (OpenAPI breaking-change gate): preflight-generated gains
	// an OPENAPI_BREAKING_BASE job env (PR base SHA, else github.sha) and a
	// "Fetch OpenAPI breaking-change base" step that shallow-fetches that
	// commit before `make spec-ci`, which now also runs the oasdiff gate; the
	// spec-ci step is renamed to say so. Reviewed delta: one env var, one
	// step, one step name; no new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.8, checks moved to Bazel): preflight-static
	// drops the CI-policy, go.mod replace, native dependency surface,
	// event-export isolation, open-core boundary, format and docs steps, and
	// preflight-generated drops its GC_REQUIRE_OAPI_CODEGEN env, the spec-ci
	// and generated-docs drift steps and the patch upload. Each now runs as a
	// Bazel test in the required bazel.yml unit lane; the OpenAPI
	// breaking-change gate (needs the git base commit) stays as its own
	// `make openapi-breaking-check` step. Reviewed delta: removed steps, one
	// removed env and one renamed step command; no new job, trigger or
	// permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.26, acceptance shard floor): TestBeadsProxiedDefault
	// was split into independent TestBeadsProxiedDefault* top-level tests, so
	// the topology job's proxied-default step selects those eight names
	// instead of the one. Same tests' assertions, same step, -timeout and env.
	// No new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.6, package integration shards moved to Bazel):
	// the eleven packages-* rows (packages-core-N-of-4,
	// packages-cmd-gc-integration, packages-runtime-tmux-N-of-6) leave
	// integration-shards for a new integration-packages-fork job with the
	// same runner, env and steps, run only for fork and Dependabot pull
	// requests (bazel.yml's gating integration-packages lane covers pushes
	// and same-repo PRs); ci-integration needs it and allows its skip.
	// Reviewed delta: one job split by condition; no new trigger, step
	// command or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.5, lint and vet as nogo): preflight-static
	// drops the static-scope classifier, the golangci-lint version/cache
	// steps, `make lint-affected`, `make lint` and `make vet` (nogo now runs
	// them inside every Bazel Go compile, gated by bazel.yml), and its
	// checkout no longer needs fetch-depth 2. Reviewed delta: removed steps
	// and one removed checkout input; no new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.50, //test/integration smoke subset moved to
	// Bazel): the bdstore and rest-smoke rows join the packages-* rows in one
	// fork/Dependabot-PR-only integration-shards job (bazel.yml's gating
	// integration-smoke and integration-packages lanes cover pushes and every
	// other PR), and integration-packages-fork goes; ci-integration drops it.
	// Reviewed delta: rows moved between two jobs of identical runner, env
	// and steps, one job removed; no new trigger, step command or permission.
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.7, cmd/gc process suite moved to Bazel): the
	// 12-shard cmd-gc-process job now runs for fork and Dependabot PRs only
	// (the integration-packages-fork condition) and its name says so. Pushes
	// and same-repo PRs run the same suite in bazel.yml's gating
	// integration-packages lane (//cmd/gc:gc_test, --config=integration,
	// GC_FAST_UNIT=0). Reviewed delta: one job's if and name; no new job,
	// trigger or permission.
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.7, worker-core conformance moved to Bazel): the
	// eight per-profile worker-core and worker-core-phase2 jobs and their two
	// summary jobs are removed, with the changes job's worker and
	// worker_phase2 filters and outputs that only they read, and ci-required
	// no longer needs the two summaries. Bazel runs the same tests with
	// PROFILE unset (every profile): workertest_test, tmux_test and gc_test
	// in the unit lane, gc_test's integration-tagged real-transport proof in
	// the integration-packages lane. Reviewed delta: removed jobs, filters,
	// outputs and needs; no new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.7, tagged suites moved to Bazel): the
	// cmd-gc-productmetrics-testhook job and preflight-static's "Native
	// DoltLite beads tests" step are removed, with the job's two ci-required
	// references. bazel.yml's unit lane runs the same tests as
	// //cmd/gc:gc_productmetrics_testhook_test (-tags productmetrics_testhook)
	// and //internal/beads:beads_native_doltlite_test (-tags
	// gascity_native_beads). Reviewed delta: one removed job and one removed
	// step; no new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.50, fork PRs on Bazel): integration-shards, the
	// last Go integration shards (packages-*, bdstore, rest-smoke, run only
	// for fork and Dependabot PRs since #7261), and cmd-gc-process (fork-only
	// since #7247) are deleted: bazel.yml's gating integration-packages and
	// integration-smoke lanes run those tests for every PR, fork ones
	// included (fork-ro run 37569466546, fork-rw run 37572755753).
	// ci-integration drops integration-shards, ci-required cmd-gc-process.
	// Reviewed delta: two jobs removed, two needs and two allowed skips
	// dropped; no new job, trigger or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.10, Docker session suite moved to Bazel): the
	// docker-session job, its `docker` changes filter/output and its
	// ci-required need and allowed skip are removed. Every scenario of the
	// real-Docker harness it ran now runs as TestDockerSessionScript
	// (//test/containerhost, emulated container host) in bazel.yml's gating
	// integration-packages lane. Reviewed delta: one job and one filter
	// removed; no new job, trigger, step command or permission.
	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.9, dashboard SPA moved to Bazel): the npm
	// dashboard job and preflight-generated's `make dashboard-ci` step (and
	// its setup-node) are removed, and ci-preflight no longer needs the job.
	// Bazel's unit lane runs the same typecheck, Vitest, build, drift and
	// Playwright steps (//internal/api/dashboardspa/...). Reviewed delta:
	// removed job, steps and need; no new job, trigger or permission.
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.7, bd contract cells moved to Bazel): the
	// contract-acceptance-previous and contract-acceptance-current jobs are
	// removed, and Check and ci-preflight no longer need them (nor allow the
	// current cell's skip). bazel.yml's unit lane runs the same tests against

	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.11, beads topology acceptance moved to Bazel):
	// the beads-topology-acceptance and beads-proxied-native-acceptance jobs
	// are removed, with the changes job's beads_topology filter and output
	// that only they read, and ci-required no longer needs them (nor allows

	//
	// Bumped again (ga-96smfk.10, K8s session suite moved to Bazel): the
	// k8s-session job, its `k8s` changes filter/output and its ci-required
	// need and allowed skip are removed. Its one step (TestK8sSessionConformance)
	// only ran with the GC_K8S_AVAILABLE secret, which was never set, so it
