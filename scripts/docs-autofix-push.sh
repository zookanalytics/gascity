# docs-autofix-push.sh - apply a CI-generated reference-docs regeneration patch
# to a PR branch, or fall back to an instructive PR comment when pushing is not
# possible.
#
# Ported from the beads project's docs-autofix pipeline; the security model is
# unchanged. Runs on the PRIVILEGED side of the docs-autofix workflow_run
# pipeline: the checkout is always the base repository's default branch
# (trusted code), and the patch produced by the unprivileged PR build is
# treated as UNTRUSTED DATA. Confinement is layered: the path allowlist below
# pins WHICH files a patch may name (exact generated paths, no wildcards, no
# traversal, no symlink modes), and `git apply --index` supplies the underlying
# escape guards (rejects `..` paths, absolute paths, and writes through
# in-patch symlinks). A hostile patch can therefore at most rewrite generated
# doc files on its own PR branch.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   BASE_REPO    base "owner/name" (e.g. gastownhall/gascity)
#   HEAD_REPO    PR head "owner/name" (same as BASE_REPO for branch PRs;
#                may be empty if the head fork was deleted)
#   HEAD_BRANCH  PR head branch name
#   HEAD_SHA     head commit the failing run was built from
#   PATCH_FILE   path to the downloaded generated-docs-freshness.patch
#   RUN_ID       workflow run id that produced the patch (for comment text)
#   RUN_URL      html url of that run (for commit/comment provenance)
#   GH_TOKEN     token for gh api calls (PR lookup, comments) - needs the
#                workflow's pull-requests:write; never the App token
#   PUSH_TOKEN   token for the git push only (optional; defaults to GH_TOKEN),
#                so the minted gastownhall-autofix App token needs
#                contents:write only
#   AUTOFIX_TOKEN_KIND  "app" when the minted App push token is in use,
#                       "default" for the workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN (retrigger
#                       caveat)
#
# Exit 0 on every non-actionable outcome (PR closed, head moved, no patch);
# exit 1 only on genuine errors so the workflow surfaces them.
