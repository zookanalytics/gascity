# rebase-resolve-lib.sh — conservative trivial-conflict auto-resolution for
# the deployer's bounded self-rebase path (bead ga-gcy0cd; architecture
# ga-h7hnpt FR-5/FR-6).
#
# is_additive_keepboth_path, resolve_conflict_markers_in_file, and
# attempt_trivial_conflict_resolution below are a PORTED COPY of
# packs/maintainer-pr-review/scripts/rebase-resolve-lib.sh (byte-identical
# logic) — copied rather than shared, matching this codebase's established
# per-pack script-copy convention (e.g. worktree-setup.sh is independently
# copied into 15+ packs). There is no shared cross-pack lib directory; do NOT
# modify the maintainer-pr-review original to stay in sync with this file or
# vice versa, and do not import across packs. If the two copies drift and
# need a bugfix in lockstep repeatedly, that's a signal to revisit the
# no-shared-lib decision (see ga-h7hnpt Trade-offs) — not to improvise an
# import here.
#
# This file ONLY defines functions; sourcing it must not produce output or
# mutate state. It is sourced by the deployer's evaluate-gate step
# (formulas/mol-deployer-gate.formula.toml, prompts/deployer.md Guardrails)
# and by tests/test-rebase-resolve.sh.
#
# DESIGN — err toward routing, never toward a wrong auto-resolve.
#
# A wrong auto-resolve silently corrupts the branch, so the bar for
# "trivial" is deliberately high. We resolve a conflicted file ONLY when EVERY
# conflict hunk in it falls into one of three provably-safe shapes:
#
#   1. IDENTICAL  — both sides of the hunk are byte-identical. Take one side.
#                   (Common when the same change was cherry-picked onto both
#                    branches.)
#
#   2. ONE-SIDE-EMPTY — one side of the hunk is empty and the other adds lines.
#                   This is a pure addition on one branch against no change on
#                   the other. Take the non-empty side. (Two branches
#                   appending to different regions of the same file
#                   frequently surface as one-side-empty hunks after rebase.)
#
#   3. ADDITIVE-BOTH on an ALLOWLISTED additive file — both sides are non-empty
#                   and differ, AND the file path is a test / doc / fixture
#                   file (the only place "just keep both" is provably safe per
#                   the operator: "it's common that a and b both add tests and
#                   we just want both"). We KEEP BOTH sides (ours then theirs),
#                   dropping only the conflict markers. We do NOT do this for
#                   source code — concatenating two divergent code edits can
#                   produce a duplicate-definition or logic corruption.
#
# If a file contains ANY hunk that is none of the above (i.e. both sides are
# non-empty, differ, and the file is NOT an allowlisted additive file), the
# whole file is declared a REAL conflict and resolution fails — the caller
# aborts the rebase and routes to the builder.
#
# Required external commands: git, awk, cmp, mktemp, tr.

# (contributor PRs are structurally out of the deployer's scope per
# prompts/deployer.md's own "never touch a contributor's work" guardrail), so
# this function does not re-derive fork/authorship — that separation is
# enforced by who calls it, not by a runtime check here. The contributor-fork
# rebase path stays exclusively maintainer-pr-review's
# attempt_rebase_against_base() in commands/run-pr.sh; this function must
# never be used as a substitute for that path.

# attempt_bounded_self_rebase <branch> [<base_ref>]

# Attempts a bounded, provably-trivial self-rebase of <branch> onto
# origin/<base_ref> (default: main) and, on success, force-with-lease-pushes
# the result. Assumes the CURRENT working tree (cwd) is already the
# deployer's checkout of <branch> — unlike maintainer-pr-review's
# attempt_rebase_against_base, this never clones or checks out a PR; the
# deployer is always already sitting in its own branch's worktree by the time
# the evaluate-gate step runs.
#
# On success (return 0), prints two lines to stdout for the caller to log to
# the bead notes for audit (FR-5's requirement):
#   BEFORE_SHA=<sha-before-rebase>
#   AFTER_SHA=<sha-after-rebase>
#
# Returns:
#   0  — rebased (trivial conflicts auto-resolved, or no conflicts at all)
#        and force-with-lease-pushed. BEFORE_SHA/AFTER_SHA printed to stdout.
#   20 — no-op: <branch> already contains origin/<base_ref>. Nothing to
#        rebase; caller should treat criterion 6 as already passing.
#   10 — setup failure: bad arguments, <branch> is a protected name
#        (main/master), cwd is not checked out to <branch>, the working tree
#        is dirty, or the fetch failed. Caller falls back to route-to-builder.
#   12 — real (non-trivial) conflict. The rebase was aborted and <branch> is
#        left exactly as it was before this call. Caller falls back to
#        route-to-builder — this is the "fall back to today's unchanged
#        behavior" path required by FR-6.
#   13 — rebased cleanly but the force-with-lease push was rejected (the
#        lease went stale — something else pushed to <branch> concurrently).
#        The local branch IS rebased but the remote is NOT updated. Caller
#        falls back to route-to-builder; the next gate cycle re-fetches and
#        retries from current state.
#   14 — rebased cleanly, but the pre-push bead-ownership/staleness guard
#        blocked the push (the bead was reassigned/closed/held/routed
#        elsewhere since this attempt began). The local branch IS rebased
