# Structural guard for the open-core boundary (infra docs:
# core-vs-commercial-boundary-v0.md, identity-tenancy-fabric-v0.md Decision 5).
#
# gascity is the MIT open-core. Multi-tenant / commercial concerns — org_id
# tenancy, the hosted control plane — live in a SEPARATE module
# (github.com/gastownhall/gascity-hosted), never in this one. The OSS module
# must build and run standalone with no commercial dependency. This check fails
# if the OSS module starts to leak commercial coupling:
#
#   (a) a .go file imports a known commercial module;
#   (b) the literal token `org_` appears in core .go — that is the COMMERCIAL
#       tenant key; the OSS core uses `tenant` / `TenantSlug`. A genuinely benign
#       hit (e.g. an OTel attribute key, a doc URL) is suppressed with a trailing
#       `// boundary:allow org_` marker on the line;
#   (c) `TenantSlug` (the OSS publication-routing label) appears on the same line
#       as an external-identity token (oidc/keycloak/jwt/eia/workos/org_id) — the
#       label must never be joined to a commercial identity (the exact collapse
#       identity-tenancy-fabric-v0 Decision 5 names as THE leak vector);
#   (d) go.mod lists a commercial module as a dependency (direct or // indirect);
#   (e) a non-empty OpenFeature EvaluationContext is constructed in core .go —
#       per-tenant flag targeting is a HOSTED concern; the core must always
#       evaluate flags with an empty context (feature-flag-system-v0 §5). This is
#       the check the `org_` grep (b) cannot see: a workspace-id / user-id / email
#       context threaded into core would sail past (b). INERT until the OpenFeature
#       dependency lands in core (Phase 1) — wired now so it bites the moment it does.
#   (f) a commercial-semantics JSON field (trial/billing/credit/plan/invoice/
#       subscription/quota/coupon/entitlement) appears in a wire struct on the
#       hosted-service surface (internal/cliauth, internal/serviceproto, the
#       gc login/whoami commands). The structural checks above cannot see a
#       commercial FIELD in a generic-looking wire type; account/commercial
#       policy must travel only in the opaque message/links fields the CLI prints
#       verbatim (service-protocol-v0 §5). Annotate a benign line with
#       `// boundary:allow commercial`.
#
# FAILS CLOSED: if a check cannot evaluate (e.g. go.mod is unreadable), that is a
# violation, not a pass. A guard that silently passes when it cannot evaluate
# manufactures false confidence.
#
# REQUIRED / BLOCKING as of the Phase-0 promotion (feature-flag ADR Resolved
# decision 1; operator-authorized 2026-07-05). The baseline was verified clean on
# origin/main before the flip. It runs as a blocking step in preflight-static — a
# violation fails the check and blocks the merge.
