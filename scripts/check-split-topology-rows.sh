#
# Drift-prevention lint for the split-store conformance suite
# (cmd/gc/split_topology_conformance_test.go, TestSplitTopologyConformance).
#
# The suite's whole value is that every invariant runs on BOTH topologies:
#
#     single-store  — routes == nil, resolveClassStore collapses every class to
#                     the work store (the legacy, pre-split city)
#     split         — routes relocate all five infrastructure classes to one
#                     binding store (the two-database city under test)
#
# forEachTopology / forEachTopologyWithRig run a t.Run per topology, so an
# invariant routed through them is guarded on both. An invariant that minted its
# own env inline (newSplitEnv(t, true)) would silently cover ONE row, and a
# regression that broke the other topology would sail through — which is exactly
# how the two production bugs this suite exists for got in: a fix that was
# correct on one store arrangement and wrong on the other. This guard forbids
# that shape:
#
#   Rule A: every invariant subtest — t.Run("I<n>...") — must invoke one of the
#           declared fan-out helpers, anywhere in its subtest body. The body is
#           read by brace balance, not by line, so the idiomatic multi-line
#           subtest is accepted and a helper call on a later line still counts.
#   Rule B: a suite file must not call newSplitEnv* directly. All env
#           construction goes through the fan-out helpers, which is where the
#           two-row expansion lives, so no invariant can pin itself to one
#           topology.
#
# Rule C is the non-empty denominator, the lesson check-routed-test-rows.sh
# learned the hard way: a rename of the t.Run naming convention would drop the
# scan to zero invariants and let Rules A and B pass vacuously, silently
# disabling the guard. Finding zero suite files, or zero invariants across them,
# is therefore a failure.
#
# DISCOVERY: the suite is found by content, not by name. Any *_test.go under
# cmd/gc that declares a t.Run("I<n>...") invariant is a suite file, so a second
# conformance file is policed the day it is added rather than the day someone
# remembers to list it here. The fixture file that DEFINES the helpers is
# excluded from Rule B — it is where newSplitEnv legitimately lives.
#
# Exits non-zero with each violation printed. Passes silently when every suite
# file is fully two-topology. Cheap + static: wired into `make check`.
