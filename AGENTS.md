# Gas City

Gas City is an orchestration-builder SDK — a Go toolkit for composing
multi-agent coding workflows. It extracts the battle-tested subsystems from
Steve Yegge's Gas Town (github.com/steveyegge/gastown) into a configurable
SDK where **all role behavior is user-supplied configuration** and the SDK
provides only infrastructure. The core principle: **ZERO hardcoded roles.**
The SDK has no built-in Mayor, Deacon, Polecat, or any other role. If a
line of Go references a specific role name, it's a bug.

You can build Gas Town in Gas City, or Ralph, or Claude Code Agent Teams,
or any other orchestration pack — via specific configurations.

**Why Gas City exists:** Gas Town proved multi-agent orchestration works,
but all its roles are hardwired in Go code. Steve realized the way work is
expressed — as beads composed into formulas — was powerful enough to abstract
roles into configuration. Gas City extracts that insight into an SDK where Gas
Town becomes one configuration among many.

## How work flows here

- **GitHub Issues is the public tracker; use an issue when it adds
  context.** Open or link one for a user-visible bug, a behavior or design
  change that needs discussion, or work that spans several pull requests:
  the issue carries the reproduction, impact, and evidence for a bug, or the
  motivation, risk, and verification plan for a change. A small,
  self-explanatory fix (a typo, a flake, a refactor, a CI or docs tweak) can
  go straight to a pull request whose description covers the why. Every pull
  request shows end-to-end evidence that the change works; when an issue
  exists, the pull request says `Closes #<issue>`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Agents:** when you do file an issue, use the bug or feature form fields,
  fill each from evidence, and answer `NOT_ENOUGH_INFO` where the evidence
  runs out.
- Branch from `main` (`fix/*`, `feat/*`, `refactor/*`, `docs/*`), use
  Conventional Commits, and push to your branch — never to `main`.
- A fix that changes an invariant or boundary updates the owning `AGENTS.md`
  in the same pull request.
- Maintainers also keep an internal bd ledger; it is optional and never
  required for contributions. See
  `engdocs/contributors/maintainer-environment.md`.

## Where new capability belongs

Prefer the lowest rung that works: a prompt or template change → pack
configuration (agents, formulas, orders) → composing existing formula and
order machinery → an adapter behind an existing provider interface → new SDK
surface. New SDK surface must pass the Primitive Test
(`engdocs/contributors/primitive-test.md`).

## Development approach

**TDD.** Write the test first, watch it fail, make it pass. Every package
has `*_test.go` files next to the code. Integration tests that need real
infrastructure (tmux, filesystem) go in `test/` with build tags.

**The architecture docs are a reference, not a blueprint.** When the DX
conflicts with the docs, DX wins. We update the docs to match.

**Search history before rebuilding.** If a feature looks missing or
regressed, check `git log -S <symbol>` / `git log --all --grep <keyword>`
first; working code is often already in history, and a removal may have been
deliberate. Treat archived plans and audits as evidence, not gospel — confirm
against current code.

## Architecture

**Orchestration is the value.** A formula is a method for how a job gets
done, and the controller (`engdocs/architecture/controller.md`) runs it as a
graph — decomposing the job into beads, fanning the ready ones out to many
agents at once, gating each step on its dependencies, retrying failures, and
draining convoys in parallel, driving the work to completion outside the
user's session. The control dispatcher (`internal/dispatch`) executes control
beads — check, retry, fan-out, tally, drain, scope-check, workflow-finalize
(`docs/reference/specs/formula-spec-v2.md` sec 0) — and that dispatcher is
the engine. Orders trigger formulas on a schedule or event; health patrol
keeps the fleet alive.

**This orchestration is composed from primitives, with ZERO hardcoded
roles.** Beads are the universal persistence substrate — work survives
sessions — and every orchestration mechanism is provably composable from the
six primitives (**Agent** = WHO, **Bead** = WHAT, **Formula** = HOW,
**Rig** = WHERE, **Pack** = CONFIGURES, **Event** = OBSERVE), defined in
`docs/getting-started/how-gas-city-works.md`. That composability is what lets
the same SDK be configured as Gas Town, Ralph, or any other pack; no role
name appears in Go. (A single agent running a formula's steps in sequence in
the user's own session — formula v1 — is still supported as a peer shape,
but graph orchestration is why Gas City exists.)

The code-layering view — how sessions, the bead store, the event bus,
config, prompt templates, and the dispatch/health machinery implement the
six primitives, plus the progressive capability levels — is
`engdocs/architecture/nine-concepts.md`.

### Layering invariants

1. **No upward dependencies.** Layer N never imports Layer N+1.
2. **Beads is the universal persistence substrate** for domain state.
3. **Events are the universal outbound-notification mechanism** — fired by
   activity so humans and agents can watch; the bus is delivery machinery.
4. **Config is the universal activation mechanism.**
5. **Side effects (I/O, process spawning) are confined to Layer 0.**
6. **The controller drives all SDK infrastructure operations.**
   No SDK mechanism may require a specific user-configured agent role.

### Invariants enforced by CI

Violating any fails the build. Details live in the linked files.

- **Object model at the center.** The CLI (`cmd/gc/`) and the HTTP+SSE API
  (`internal/api/`) are projections over the domain packages; neither
  re-implements domain logic (`internal/api/AGENTS.md`).
- **Typed wire and typed events.** No hand-written JSON or untyped wire
  types; the OpenAPI spec is generated (`TestOpenAPISpecInSync`); every
  event type has a registered payload
  (`TestEveryKnownEventTypeHasRegisteredPayload`).
- **Vendor-neutral hosted-service wire.** Commercial policy is never a wire
  field (`internal/cliauth/AGENTS.md`, `scripts/check-core-boundary.sh`).
- **Worker boundary (active migration).** Production `cmd/gc` code reaches
  sessions through `worker.Handle`
  (`TestGCNonTestFilesStayOnWorkerBoundary`; `internal/worker/AGENTS.md`).
- **Agent config field sync.** A new `config.Agent` field is wired in every
  copy and merge site (`TestAgentFieldSync` and siblings;
  `internal/config/AGENTS.md`).

**Session-first (completed `dd90ac0a` on Mar 8 2026).** The former Agent
Protocol primitive was removed; responsibilities moved to
`internal/session/` (lifecycle) and `internal/runtime/` (providers).
`internal/agent/` is now a helper package with session-name utilities and
startup hints — not a primitive. Do not reconstruct the `Agent` / `Handle`
interfaces.

## Design decisions (settled)

These decisions are final. Do not revisit them.

- **City-as-directory model.** A city is a directory on disk containing
  `city.toml`, `.gc/` runtime state, and `rigs/` infrastructure.
- **Fresh binary, not a Gas Town fork.** We build `gc` from scratch.
- **TOML for config.** `pack.toml` (definition) and `city.toml` (deployment) are the config files.
- **Tutorials win over architecture docs.** When the docs disagree, we update the docs.
- **No premature abstraction.** Don't build interfaces until two
  implementations exist.
- **Mayor is overseer, not worker.** The mayor plans; coding agents work.
- **`internal/` packages for now.** SDK exports (`pkg/`) are future work.
  Everything is private to the `gc` binary until the API stabilizes.
- **ZERO hardcoded roles.** Roles are pure configuration. No role name
  appears in Go source code.

## Key design principles

- **Keep judgment out of Go.** Go handles transport, not reasoning. The
  framework moves work; it doesn't reason about it. If a line of Go contains
  a judgment call, it's a violation. **The test:** does any line of Go contain
  a judgment call? An `if stuck then restart` is framework intelligence. Move
  the decision to the prompt.
- **A primitive must become more useful as models improve.** Every primitive
  should grow MORE useful as models improve, not less. Don't build heuristics
  or decision trees.
- **If you find work on your hook, you run it.** No confirmation, no waiting.
  The hook having work IS the assignment. This is rendered into agent prompts
  via templates, not enforced by Go code.
- **The system converges because work persists.** The system converges to
  correct outcomes because work (beads), hooks, and molecules are all
  persistent. Sessions come and go; the work survives. Multiple independent
  observers check the same state idempotently and converge on it. Redundancy
  is the reliability mechanism.
- **No status files — query live state.** Never write PID files, lock files,
  or state files to track running processes. Always discover state by querying
  the system directly (process table, port scans, `ps`, `lsof`). Status files
  go stale on crash and create false positives. The process table is the
  single source of truth for "what is running."
- **SDK self-sufficiency.** Every SDK infrastructure operation (gate
  evaluation, health patrol, bead lifecycle, order dispatch) must
  function with only the controller running. No SDK operation may
  depend on a specific user-configured agent role existing. The
  controller drives infrastructure; user agents execute work. Test:
  if removing a `[[agent]]` entry breaks an SDK feature, it's a
  violation.

## What Gas City does NOT contain

These are permanent exclusions, not "not yet." Each fails the test of
becoming more useful as models improve — it becomes LESS useful instead.

- **No skills system** — the model IS the skill system
- **No capability flags** — a sentence in the prompt is sufficient
- **No MCP/tool registration** — if a tool has a CLI, the agent uses it
- **No decision logic in Go** — the agent decides from prompt and reality
- **No hardcoded role names** — roles are pure configuration

## Code conventions

- Unit tests next to code: `config.go` → `config_test.go`
- `t.TempDir()` for filesystem tests
- Integration tests use `//go:build integration`
- `cobra` for CLI, `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` for config
- Atomic file writes: temp file → `os.Rename`
- No panics in library code — return errors
- Error messages include context: `fmt.Errorf("adding rig %q: %w", name, err)`
- Don't swallow errors: no silently filled-in defaults, masked decode
  failures, or ignored timeouts.
- Comments describe current behavior; don't narrate removed functionality.
- Role names never appear in Go code. If you're writing `if role == "mayor"`,
  it's a design error.
- **Tmux safety:** Never run bare `tmux kill-server` as cleanup. Never kill the
  default tmux server. If tmux cleanup is required, target only the known
  city/test socket explicitly with `tmux -L <socket> ...`, or prefer `gc stop`
  for city shutdown. Treat personal tmux servers as out of bounds.
- **Git safety:** Never run `git checkout <ref> -- .` (or any pathspec
  checkout) in a worktree you do not own — above all the shared rig root
  (`$GC_RIG_ROOT`). Unlike `git checkout <ref>`, the pathspec form overwrites
  the index and worktree for every tracked path, moves no HEAD (so no reflog
  entry) and stages nothing (so no dangling blob): overwritten uncommitted
  work is unrecoverable. To read a file at a ref use `git show <ref>:<path>`.
  To check something out, use your own worktree or a disposable
  `git worktree add`.
- **Non-interactive shell:** `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to `-i` and
  hang an agent; use `cp -f`, `mv -f`, `rm -f`, `rm -rf`, `cp -rf`. Use
  `-o BatchMode=yes` for `ssh`/`scp`, `-y` for `apt-get`, and
  `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` for `brew`.

## Build and test

**Bazel is the build and test system; `bazel test` is what CI gates on**
(`.github/workflows/bazel.yml`). Plain `go test` is a quick inner-loop
convenience only: it skips nogo lint/vet, formatting, generated-artifact
and policy targets, and a green `go test` is not evidence a change passes CI.

| Tier | Command (`make` alias) |
|---|---|
| Unit + nogo + format + generated + policy | `bazel test //...` (`make test`) |
| One package while iterating | `bazel test //internal/config:config_test` |
| Acceptance (Tier A) | `bazel test --config=acceptance //test/acceptance:acceptance_test` (`make test-acceptance`) |
| Integration-tagged packages (gating) | `bazel test --config=integration //test:integration_packages` |
| `test/integration` (evidence-only in CI) | `bazel test --config=integration //test/integration:integration_test` |
| Docs sync | `bazel test //test/docsync:docsync_test` (`make check-docs`) |

- **Where it runs.** Agent hosts' `~/.bazelrc` names rbe-west's executor, so
  plain `bazel test` executes remotely; never run whole-repo `go test`
  fan-out on shared hosts. Contributors use `--config=fork-cache` (anonymous
  read-only cache, local execution of misses); maintainers with an rbe-west
  client certificate use `--config=remote-exec` (ask your human before
  adding either to `.bazelrc.local`). Details: TESTING.md
  "Bazel cache tiers" and `engdocs/bazel-quickstart.md`.
- **BUILD files.** After changing imports or adding packages or files, run
  `make bazel-sync` and commit the result; the `BUILD files in sync` CI gate
  fails otherwise. Never commit machine-specific endpoints; they belong in
  `.bazelrc.local`.
- **Go-native twins** (`make test-go`, `make check-go`, `make
  test-acceptance-go`, `make test-integration-go`, `make test-fast-parallel`)
  exist for offline work and hosts Bazel does not serve (macOS jobs).
- **Never run `go clean -cache`** — it corrupts shared build caches.
  `go clean -testcache` is fine. Maintainers on the shared build hosts: read
  `engdocs/contributors/maintainer-environment.md` before touching `GOCACHE`
  or `TMPDIR`.
- **Git hooks:** `make setup` installs `.githooks` as `core.hooksPath`;
  `make check-hooks` verifies it. Pre-commit runs nogo on staged packages;
  pre-push runs `bazel test //...` and says loudly when it falls back to
  `go test`. Beads' installer can silently take the path over and skip every
  gate — see "Git hook ownership" in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Code quality gates

Before considering any task complete:

- `make check` passes (`bazel test //...` plus the shell guards; nogo is
  lint and vet)
- Acceptance or integration behavior changed: the matching `--config` tier
  above passes
- `.githooks/pre-commit` is active locally (verify with `make check-hooks`)
  and has run for the staged change
- `make dashboard-check` passes (the dashboard's Bazel targets: typecheck,
  Vitest, build, and drift checks, which `bazel test //...` also runs) and the
  dashboard serves locally (a manual `npm run preview` step) for any change
  touching the API, the OpenAPI spec, or the dashboard
  (`internal/api/AGENTS.md`)
- Every exported function has a doc comment
- No premature abstractions
- Tests cover happy path AND edge cases
