# Forward one git hook invocation to beads.
#
# Only one directory can own core.hooksPath. Beads' installer claims it for
# .beads/hooks, and those hooks exec `bd hooks run <hook>` without chaining
# onward — so while beads owned the path, every gate in .githooks (staged-Go
# formatting, lint-changed (nogo lint and vet), the three codegen+stage steps, the
# push-time suite) was silently skipped, and spec-derived drift reached the
# mainline. .githooks is the single owner instead, and calls beads from here so
# both keep running.
#
# The exit-code carve-outs below intentionally mirror the beads integration
# block, so moving ownership changes nothing about how beads itself behaves.
#
# Usage: .githooks/lib/beads-chain.sh <hook-name> [hook-args...]
