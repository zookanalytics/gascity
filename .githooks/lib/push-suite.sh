# The push-time test suite, called by .githooks/pre-push when Go sources change.
#
# `bazel test //...` hashes every action exactly like CI does (the committed
# .bazelrc pins every key-affecting flag; scripts/bazel_key_parity_test.go),
# so a push reuses what pre-push, PR and main runs already computed. Three
# tiers (TESTING.md "Bazel cache tiers"):
#
#   contributor  --config=fork-cache: rbe-west's anonymous read-only cache;
#                misses run on this machine and nothing is uploaded.
#   maintainer   --config=remote-exec: some rc file names a remote executor
#                and the maintainer's mTLS client certificate, either
#                .bazelrc.local's build:remote-exec lines or a machine rc
#                (agent hosts set `build --remote_executor=...` in ~/.bazelrc).
#   CI           the trusted writer (bazel.yml); never this script.
#
# GC_PREPUSH_SUITE picks the mode (default auto):
#   auto   remote-exec when bazel is installed and its effective options name
#          a remote executor; fork-cache when bazel is installed without one
#          and .bazelrc's pinned test PATH has `go`; make test-fast-parallel
#          otherwise.
#   rbe    --config=remote-exec; fails when no rc names an executor (the suite
#          would otherwise compile and run on this machine at --jobs=64).
#   cache  --config=fork-cache (it resets any rc's executor).
#   go     make test-fast-parallel (plain go test, the pre-Bazel suite), with a
#          banner saying it is not what CI enforces. auto falls back to it
#          (with the same banner and the reason) only when bazel cannot run.
#
# Remote execution also needs a current worker-env pin (worker_env_refusal
# below): rbe-west's workers serve only main's pin. On a stale pin, or an open
# drift issue for main's pin, auto picks the non-remote mode and rbe fails.
