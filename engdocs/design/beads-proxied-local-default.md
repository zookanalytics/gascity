# Beads proxied-local default

> **Status:** Accepted — implemented against beads `v1.3.0-rc.2`.
> **Companion to:** `engdocs/design/beads-dolt-contract-redesign.md` (the bd+Dolt
> contract this specialises), `docs/reference/exec-beads-provider.md` (the exec
> lifecycle protocol the adapter speaks).

A fresh `gc init` produces a **bd-owned proxied-server** store: bd runs a
detached `bd db-proxy-child`, which runs `dolt sql-server` rooted at
`<scope>/.beads/dolt`. Gas City never spawns Dolt for such a scope. Existing
direct/server, embedded, DoltLite and external scopes are untouched.

The escape hatch is explicit: `gc init --beads-transport direct --beads-target
local` (or `GC_BEADS_TRANSPORT`/`GC_BEADS_TARGET`) yields a **bd-owned
server-mode** store — `bd init --server`, with bd's own
`.beads/dolt-server.pid`/`.port`, started and stopped by `bd dolt start`/`bd
dolt stop`. It is not the legacy gc-managed server. The gc-managed server is
reached only by a scope that already has one: an existing city whose metadata
says `dolt_mode: server`, or the legacy `--dolt-host` alias used without a
selector. `gc rig add` has no selectors — a rig inherits the city's topology,
and only from a city that is itself provider-owned (see below).

### bd version floor

Every **fresh** provider-owned init needs bd ≥ 1.3.0 — the default one as much
as a selector-driven one, because both journal a pending ownership record and
`checkHardDependencies` raises the floor whenever one exists
(`bdFreshProviderMinVersion`). On an older bd, `gc init` refuses typed before
touching the store: `missing required dependencies: bd (found vX, need
v1.3.0+)`. There is no silent fallback to the legacy path. The only fresh init
that stays on the 1.0.4 floor is the legacy `--dolt-host` alias used without
`--beads-transport`/`--beads-target`, which is a client-only external
binding. `beads.bd_compatibility` in `city.toml` is a different knob: it
selects which bd CLI *semantics* gc relies on at runtime and does not lower or
raise this init floor.

### External targets

`--beads-target external` requires `--dolt-host`, `--dolt-port` and
`--dolt-database` (or `GC_DOLT_HOST`/`GC_DOLT_PORT`/`GC_DOLT_DATABASE`). The
database is required because it names *which* database on a server somebody
else operates; letting bd derive one from the issue prefix would attach to, or
create, the wrong database there.

`--dolt-project-id` is **not** required with a selector, and is not honoured on
that path: gc journals host/port/database only and hands bd just `--database`,
and bd resolves `project_id` itself (adopting the hosted database's
`_project_id` or minting one). It stays required for the legacy `--dolt-host`
alias, which is the one path that writes the identity
(`contract.WriteProjectIdentity`).

## Topology authority is bd

`dolt_mode` in `<scope>/.beads/metadata.json` is the persisted truth. bd writes
it there and nowhere else (`config.yaml` carries no `dolt.mode`), and it
git-commits the file, so the mode propagates to clones. `city.toml` has no
`[dolt].mode`; adding one back would create a second topology store that can
disagree with bd.

## The ownership journal is intent, not topology

`.gc/scope-ownership.json` is a crash-safe record of an initialization Gas City
started, not a description of a running system. Its states:

- `provider_initializing` — carries the requested `intent` (transport/target)
  and, for an external target, the `endpoint` (host/port/database) the scope
  must initialize against. That endpoint is journaled because it used to live
  only in the initializing process: a `gc init` that died after writing the
  record left every retry unable to reach its upstream.
- `ready` — intent and endpoint are cleared. bd's own binding is authoritative
  from that point; a retained copy would outrank it on a later repair.

The journal keys are `city`, `rig:<name>`, and `path:<abs>` — the last being a
rig detached from `city.toml` by removal, rename, or an interrupted add.

## Provider-owned classification

A scope's beads lifecycle belongs to the provider when **either**:

1. the ownership journal has a record for it, **or**
2. its committed `.beads/ownership-handoff.json` projects a completed handoff,
   **or**
3. bd's own metadata says `backend: dolt` and `dolt_mode: proxied-server`.

Arm 2 is a reader, and on rc.2 nothing writes what it reads: no bd release
performs the handoff yet, and gc will never write that journal — it is bd's
record of bd's own transfer. It is here because the answer it gives gates
whether gc may raise a second `sql-server` over a scope bd owns, so gc
authenticates the record in full rather than trusting its phase field.

Arm 3 is what makes an *un-journaled* proxied scope work. A workspace migrated
in place with `bd migrate from-server-to-proxied-server`, or cloned from a
proxied city, has no journal record, and classifying it as legacy meant
`gc stop` and `gc doctor` skipped it entirely while bd happily ran its
processes. A scope classified this way is `ready` by construction, and its
transport/target come from the binding (metadata plus the
`proxied_server_client_info.json` sidecar), never from the journal.

Malformed metadata is an error, not a legacy classification. Guessing who owns
a live Dolt process is how a scope ends up with two.

The same classification is the fence on gc's own managed-Dolt verbs: `gc
dolt-state start-managed`/`stop-managed`/`probe-managed` refuse a scope it
answers yes for, so an un-journaled proxied city cannot get a second,
gc-managed `sql-server` raised over bd's proxy root.

**Inheritance is downward only.** A fresh rig becomes provider-owned only when
the *city* already is. A rig added to a grandfathered GC-managed direct city
stays on the legacy inherited-city path — a database on the city's one managed
server — because journaling it would run a bare `bd init --server` in the rig
and give the city a second Dolt lifecycle owner that the dolt pack's orders and
backups do not cover. Converting an existing city is `bd migrate`'s job, not a
side effect of `gc rig add` or a re-run of `gc init`.

**Refusal.** bd commits `metadata.json` and gitignores the store itself, so a
clone of a proxied workspace carries `dolt_mode: proxied-server` without any
data. Serving it would silently create an empty store that reads as an empty
tracker. `gc start`, `gc rig add`, health and recover refuse such a scope with a
typed error before invoking bd at all; `gc stop` still reaches it, because a
refusal to clean up is not a safety property.

## Stop semantics

`bd dolt stop` for provider-owned scopes runs **last** on every stop path:

```
controller (agents drain with it) -> sessions -> orphan sessions ->
runtime server teardown -> bd dolt stop per provider-owned scope
```

The order is load-bearing. `BEADS_DOLT_AUTO_START=0` is **inert** on bd's
proxied path — every ordinary command short-circuits into the proxied UOW
provider (beads `cmd/bd/main.go:1758`) before auto-start policy is read — so
**any bd read restarts the proxy and its Dolt child**, measured at ~0.6s. A
dashboard sample, a `gc doctor`, or one straggler agent surviving the stop
undoes it. `applyProxiedDoltEnv` therefore drops the variable for proxied
scopes rather than projecting a promise bd does not keep.

Stop is re-runnable. `bd dolt stop` is idempotent on the proxied path (exit 0,
`stopped`/`verified` true, with or without a live proxy); on the direct path bd
exits 1 with "dolt server is not running", which the adapter maps to success so
a second `gc stop` is a clean no-op.

The fan-out covers the city, every configured rig (each workspace gets its own
proxy root, so each needs its own stop), and — for retiring operations only —
every record in the journal, whatever its key. Start deliberately does *not*
reach detached records: reviving a rig the operator removed is worse than
leaving it alone. A `city.toml` that no longer parses does not block the stop
fan-out either; stranding bd's processes behind a config error is the same leak
by another route, and that is precisely the case where the journal's
`rig:<name>` records are the only remaining list of what this city owns.

A retiring op attempts **every** scope before it reports anything. One rig whose
`bd dolt stop` refuses — bd declines an unverifiable proxy record without
`--force` — must not leave the rest resident, so failures are collected and
returned together. gc does not escalate to `--force`: rc.2 exposes the
force-eligible condition only as message text, and signalling a PID bd could not
identify is irreversible. Health reports the same way, so one bad scope cannot
hide the state of the others.

## Idle policy

GC-owned proxied scopes are initialized with `--proxied-server-idle-timeout 0`
(bd's `IdleTimeoutNever`, recorded as `"idle_timeout": -1` in the client-info
sidecar). Both proxied targets get it: local and external alike own a *local*
proxy plus its Dolt child, only the data upstream differs. Without it bd's
30s default retires the pair after every quiet period and each later command
pays a proxy-plus-Dolt cold start.

Readiness is a single `bd ping`, with no outer retry loop: bd's provider open
already waits up to 15s for the proxy endpoint and then up to 30s for the Dolt
child. Gas City widens the operation budget to 60s for owned proxied
start/ensure-ready/health/recover instead of stacking a second wait on top of
bd's.

Never call `bd dolt start` or `bd dolt status` on a proxied scope: neither is
proxied-aware in rc.2, and `start` would launch a second unmanaged `sql-server`
over the same data directory.

## Topology matrix

Proving the default works says nothing about the shapes it did not change, and
those are where this feature broke things. `TestBeadsInitTopologyMatrix`
(`test/acceptance/beads_topology_matrix_test.go`) walks every supported way to
initialise a beads scope through the same command list — init, doctor, `gc bd`
create/list/show, `gc rig add`, `gc start` with the default pack composition,
`gc status`, `gc stop`, `gc start`, `gc stop` — against a real bd and a real
dolt, and measures each against the shape it is supposed to produce. The shapes
themselves live in `test/acceptance/helpers/beads_topology.go`, so adding one is
a table entry.

| shape | selector | topology | ownership journal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 proxied-local | none (the default) | `bd db-proxy-child` + its own `dolt sql-server` under `<scope>/.beads/dolt` | city and rig, ready |
| M2 direct-local | `--beads-transport direct --beads-target local` | one bd-owned `dolt sql-server` per scope, recorded in `.beads/dolt-server.pid`/`.port` | city and rig, ready |
| M3a direct-external (alias) | `--dolt-host/--dolt-port/--dolt-database/--dolt-project-id` | none local; a database somebody else operates | none — canonical city endpoint |
| M3b direct-external (selector) | `--beads-transport direct --beads-target external` plus the endpoint | none local; bd persists the upstream in `metadata.json` | city and rig, ready |
| M4 proxied-external | `--beads-transport proxied --beads-target external` plus the endpoint | a local `bd db-proxy-child` fronting the external server, no local Dolt child | city and rig, ready |
| M5 legacy GC-managed | a gc built before the journal | gc's own `sql-server` under `.gc/runtime/packs/dolt`, rigs inherit it | none, and none may appear |
| M6 doltlite | `GC_BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` | none at all | none |
| M7 deferred | `GC_DOLT=skip` | nothing at init; `gc start` finishes it into M1 | `provider_initializing` at init, ready after start |

Where a shape legitimately cannot do a step, the matrix pins the typed outcome
rather than skipping: M6 records the refusal `gc bd create` returns, because
`gc init` never runs the adapter's doltlite init op and no embedded store is
created — a limitation that predates this work and is equally true on main.
M3a and M5 are allowed one doctor failure before their first `gc start`
(`custom-types:city`), because a store gc did not create carries whoever's bead
vocabulary made it until gc's lifecycle has run over it once. After start there
are no allowances.

M3a and M3b both need a hosted database; the fixture provisions M3a's with
`bd init --server` out of band, because the `--dolt-host` alias binds a city to
a database somebody else operates rather than creating one.

Running it locally:

```bash
GC_ACCEPTANCE_BD_BIN=/data/tmp/bd-rc2/bd \
GC_ACCEPTANCE_LEGACY_GC_BIN=/data/tmp/gc-dolt-takeover/gc-main \
TMPDIR=/data/tmp make test-beads-topology-matrix
```

One shape at a time while iterating:

```bash
GC_ACCEPTANCE_BD_BIN=/data/tmp/bd-rc2/bd TMPDIR=/data/tmp make test-acceptance \
  ACCEPTANCE_TIMEOUT=20m \
  ACCEPTANCE_GO_TEST_FLAGS='-count=1 -v -run TestBeadsInitTopologyMatrix/M4'
```

Both variables are documented in `TESTING.md`. Without an rc.2 bd the whole
matrix skips, so CI is unaffected; without `GC_ACCEPTANCE_LEGACY_GC_BIN` only
the legacy shape skips.

## Migrating a legacy GC-managed city (the supported rc.2 path)

`gc beads city migrate-proxied` is the **only** supported way to move an
existing GC-managed direct city onto the proxied default on rc.2:

```
gc stop  →  gc beads city migrate-proxied [--dry-run] [--json]  →  gc start
```

It is an ordering and residue command, not a second migration: bd's own
`bd migrate from-server-to-proxied-server` does the work, city first, then each
rig. Around it gc supplies the four things bd cannot:

1. **The stopped fence.** bd's running-server precondition consults only its
   own `.beads/dolt-server.pid`, which gc never writes. Migrating onto a live
   gc-owned server commits the mode flip and then cannot start the proxy,
   because Dolt still holds the exclusive data-dir lock — the scope is unusable
   until the old server dies. gc refuses instead, and re-checks immediately
   before each `bd migrate`, not just once at entry.
2. **`dolt init` in the city's data directory**, and only there, and only when
   `.dolt/repo_state.json` is missing. gc's multi-database data dir was never a
   Dolt repository, and bd's root validator requires one.
3. **The rig's relative `dolt_data_dir`.** Every legacy rig's database lives
   inside the *city's* data dir. The value must be relative: beads strips an
   absolute one on save, and bd saves the config mid-migration.
4. **Residue retirement.** The canonical config rewrite drops gc's endpoint
   keys and `dolt.mode`, and gc's own `.gc/runtime/packs/dolt` publication and
   `.beads/dolt-server.port` mirrors are retired by the command.

Every scope it will not touch is refused by name, and the refusals are the
point: a provider-owned or handed-off scope, an external endpoint, an embedded
or non-Dolt store, and a rig that owns a store of its own. An already-proxied
scope is a no-op. Each scope is independent and idempotent, so a partly failed
run is finished by running it again; `--dry-run` prints the exact per-scope plan
and writes nothing. Procedure, refusals and recovery:
`engdocs/runbooks/beads-migrate-proxied.md`.

## Deliberately not done

- **Native SQL over the proxy.** Proxied scopes read and write through the bd
  CLI (`BdStore`). Dialing `127.0.0.1:<proxy.pid port>` on the MySQL wire is
  feasible — rc.2 has no supported library open for a proxied workspace — but
  connection-lifetime ownership, idle semantics and proxy identity are a
  separate design. The CLI front door costs a fork per operation, which is a
  real regression for controller-heavy cities.
- **The journaled legacy→bd ownership handoff.** Not available on rc.2, and no
  part of it ships here. An earlier revision of this branch carried a hidden
  `gc dolt-state handoff-inspect`/`handoff-stop` protocol for bd to drive gc as
  a subprocess. That shape is withdrawn: **bd never calls gc.** bd spawns
  nothing but `dolt`, it has no provider, hook or callback into its caller, and
  everything it needs about the caller arrives as command-line input. A
  transfer built the other way round makes bd's ownership journal depend on a
  binary it cannot verify, and makes gc's refusals reachable only through bd.

  When the handoff does land it will be **gc-orchestrated over bd verbs**: bd
  grows a phased, journal-driven `bd migrate ownership-handoff`
  (`prepare` → `legacy-gone` → `configure` → `verify` → `commit`, with
  `rollback`/`rollback-finish` and a non-mutating `status`), bd owns the
  journal, the replacement server, the fences and the rollback, and gc calls
  those verbs in order — stopping and restarting only its own legacy server in
  between. No such beads tag exists yet, so gc ships no driver for it. What gc
  keeps here is the reading half: the committed-journal projection and the
  three-arm ownership classification, so that a scope bd has taken over is
  recognised as bd's the moment such a journal exists.
- **Remote hosted proxies and Windows/macOS proxied lifecycle.** rc.2 defines
  but does not implement the latter.

## rc.2 refusal matrix

Proxied mode is `[EXPERIMENTAL]` in rc.2 and refuses a list of verbs —
`doctor`, `backup*`, `restore`, `diff`, `flatten`, `migrate*`, `branch`,
`vc*`, `sync`, `--readonly`, `--max-rows`, `--watch` and more. The authority is
beads `cmd/bd/proxy_capability.go`; packs and orders that call those verbs
against a proxied scope fail typed. The dashboard and doctor use `bd ping`
rather than `bd doctor --readonly` for exactly this reason.

`backup*` is on that list, and it is the one refusal with a data consequence:
on rc.2 a proxied scope has no backup, by anyone. gc cannot register a Dolt
backup against a proxy root it does not own, `mol-dog-backup` talks to the
managed server a proxied scope does not have, and bd refuses its own verb. The
per-scope doctor checks therefore go quiet — correctly, since there is nothing
to register and a permanent warning is a line nobody can clear — so doctor says
it instead in `rig:<name>:dolt-backup`'s message and once per city in the
`proxied-backup-coverage` advisory. Until beads lifts the refusal, the store
under the proxy root is the only copy; copy it out of band.
