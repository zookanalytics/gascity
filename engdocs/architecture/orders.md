## Summary

Orders are Gas City's derived mechanism (Layer 2-4, part of Formulas
& Molecules) for scheduled and event-driven work dispatch without human
intervention. Each order pairs a trigger condition (when to fire) with
an action (a shell script or formula wisp), living as an
`order.toml` file inside formula directories. The controller
evaluates all non-manual triggers on every pass of its orders lane (about
once per patrol interval, off the controller tick) and dispatches due
orders -- exec orders run shell scripts directly with no LLM
involvement, while formula orders instantiate wisps dispatched to
agent pools.

## Key Concepts

- **Order**: A parsed definition from an `order.toml` file with
  a Name (derived from subdirectory name), a dispatch action (Formula or
  Exec, mutually exclusive), a Trigger type, trigger-specific parameters, and
  optional Pool routing. Defined in the `Order` struct at
  `internal/orders/order.go`.

- **Trigger**: The trigger condition that controls when an order fires.
  Five types exist: `cooldown` (minimum interval since last run), `cron`
  (5-field schedule matching), `condition` (shell command exits 0),
  `event` (matching events after a cursor position), and `manual`
  (explicit invocation only, never auto-fires). See
  `internal/orders/triggers.go`.

- **Exec Order**: An order whose action is a shell command
  (`exec` field) run directly by the controller. No LLM, no agent, no
  wisp. The script receives `ORDER_DIR` in its environment, set to
  the directory containing the `order.toml` file. Default timeout:
  60 seconds.

- **Formula Order**: An order whose action is a formula name
  (`formula` field). When the trigger opens, the controller calls `MolCook`
  to instantiate a wisp and labels it for pool dispatch. Default timeout:
  30 seconds.

- **ScopedName**: A rig-qualified key that creates unique identity for
  orders across rigs. City-level orders use the plain name
  (e.g., `dolt-health`). Rig-level orders append `:rig:<rigName>`
  (e.g., `dolt-health:rig:demo-repo`). ScopedName drives independent
  cooldown tracking, event cursors, and label scoping.

- **Formula Layer**: A directory scanned for `orders/*/order.toml`.
  Layers are ordered lowest to highest priority; a higher-priority layer's
  order definition overrides a lower-priority one with the same
  subdirectory name (last-wins semantics).

- **Tracking Bead**: A bead created synchronously before each dispatch
  goroutine launches, labeled `order-run:<scopedName>`. Serves dual
  purpose: prevents the cooldown trigger from re-firing on the next tick,
  and provides execution history for `gc order history`.

## Architecture

The order subsystem spans two packages:

- **`internal/orders/`** -- parsing, validation, scanning, and trigger
  evaluation. Pure library code with no side effects beyond shell command
  execution for condition triggers.
- **`cmd/gc/`** -- controller-side dispatch (`order_dispatch.go`)
  and CLI commands (`cmd_order.go`). Wires the library into the
  controller loop and the `gc order` command tree.

### Data Flow

**Discovery (on controller start and config reload):**

1. `buildOrderDispatcher()` resolves city-level formula layers via
   `cityFormulaLayers()` and calls `orders.Scan()` to find city
   orders.
2. For each rig, `rigExclusiveLayers()` strips the city prefix from the
   rig's formula layers to avoid double-scanning city orders. The
   remaining rig-exclusive layers are scanned separately.
3. Rig orders get their `Rig` field stamped with the rig name.
4. Manual-trigger orders are filtered out (they never auto-dispatch).
5. If no auto-dispatchable orders remain, the dispatcher is nil
   (nil-guard pattern -- callers check before use).

**When dispatch runs (the orders lane):**

Order dispatch runs on its own lane (`cmd/gc/orders_lane.go`), off the
controller tick: a due order never waits behind session reconciliation, and
the tick never waits on order gates.

- **Startup.** `run()` dispatches once synchronously before the cold-start
  session reconcile (MAINT-008), then starts the lane, so orders keep
  dispatching while that reconcile runs.
- **Wakes and the duty cycle.** Each controller tick that gets past its
  FS-pressure gate wakes the lane at the point where the tick used to
  dispatch. A wake starts a pass at once if the lane has been idle, since
  its previous pass ended, at least as long as that pass ran. Otherwise the
  wake waits until it has, and every wake in that wait (including one that
  lands mid-pass) joins the single pass that follows. The lane is busy at
  most half the time while a pass fits in the patrol interval (a longer
  pass is followed by one interval idle), never runs two passes back to
  back, and a city with short passes keeps the tick's poke latency.
- **Backstop timer.** One timer, reset at the end of every pass, runs a pass
  one patrol interval after the previous pass ended if nothing else has, so
  a wedged or slow tick does not stop dispatch. A waiting wake never waits
  longer than the backstop. Where a pass outlasts the patrol interval (on
  maintainer-city a pass is ~32s against a 15s interval), the backstop
  always comes first and the lane runs one pass per interval plus pass
  time.
- **A pass** applies the FS-pressure gate (the tick's rule: skip while
  pressure is high, force a pass after `maxConsecutiveFSPressureSkips`; the
  lane counts its own skips, so the tick's forced passes do not reset
  them). Unlike the tick's gate, which a config change bypasses, the
  lane's gate has no config-change bypass: under sustained pressure a
  config change waits for the lane's own forced pass, up to
  `maxConsecutiveFSPressureSkips`+1 passes. After the gate, a pass runs
  the managed-Dolt preflight and the periodic order rescan, installs any
  staged dispatcher (a reload's, or the rescan's), runs the
  tracking/nudge-mail watchdogs, and calls `dispatch()`. A panic
  is recovered per pass (`safeTick`). Each pass is its own trace cycle
  with trigger `orders`.
- **Reloads never wait on a pass.** A pass holds the lane's `passMu` for the
  live dispatcher, the retired dispatchers and the watchdog clocks. A config
  reload stages the rebuilt dispatcher and installs it at once if the lane
  is idle. Otherwise the next pass installs it, draining the outgoing
  dispatcher first. A pass already in flight when the reload lands
  finishes on the outgoing dispatcher.
- **Generation guard.** A reload that stages a dispatcher bumps an
  order-set generation, after it has published its config. A full reload
  always stages; a same-revision reload stages only when its rescan finds
  the order set changed; a superseded reload never stages. Each pass reads
  the generation and the one config snapshot the whole pass uses (trace,
  rescan, watchdogs) as a pair, under the lock the bump takes, so no stage
  lands between them. The rescan stages its result only if the generation
  is unchanged, so a rescan of pre-reload config can never overwrite the
  reload's dispatcher.
- **Shutdown.** `run()` cancels and joins the lane on every exit, so a
  normal shutdown drains the dispatchers with the lane stopped. A forced
  shutdown can overlap a pass that is still running. Then it logs
  `orders lane still running; skipping order dispatcher drain` and skips
  the drain rather than block on the pass or race it. Tracking beads left
  open are closed by the orphaned-tracking sweep on the next start.
- **Visibility.** Each tick that wakes the lane (so not a pressure-skipped
  or canceled tick) records a `wake_orders_lane` operation whose
  `backstop_ran`, `backstop_age_seconds` and `backstop_last_reason` fields
  give the age and trigger of the lane's last pass that reached dispatch.
  Passes the FS gate skips do not count, so an age that keeps growing means
  the lane is stuck or starved by pressure.

**Trigger evaluation and dispatch (on each lane pass):**

1. `dispatch()` iterates all non-manual orders.
2. `CheckTrigger()` evaluates the trigger condition against current time,
   last-run history (from bead store), and event state (from event bus).
3. For each due order, a tracking bead is created **synchronously**
   with label `order-run:<scopedName>`. This is critical: it
   prevents the cooldown trigger from re-firing on the next pass.
4. A goroutine calls `dispatchOne()` with a context timeout derived from
   `effectiveTimeout()` (per-order timeout capped by global
   `max_timeout`).
5. `dispatchOne()` records an `order.fired` event, then branches:
   - **Exec**: `dispatchExec()` runs the shell command via `ExecRunner`,
     labels the tracking bead with `exec` (or `exec-failed`), and
     records `order.completed` or `order.failed`.
   - **Formula**: `dispatchWisp()` calls `instantiateWisp()` (which
     delegates to `store.MolCook()`), labels the wisp root bead with
     `order-run:<scopedName>` and `pool:<qualifiedPool>`, and
     records `order.completed` or `order.failed`.

**Scanning (`orders.Scan()`):**

1. For each formula layer (ordered lowest to highest priority), read
   `<layer>/orders/*/order.toml`.
2. Parse each TOML file into an `Order` struct. Set `Name` from the
   subdirectory name, `Source` from the absolute file path.
3. Higher-priority layers overwrite lower ones by name (map keyed on
   subdirectory name).
4. Exclude disabled orders (`enabled = false`) and those in the
   `skip` list.
5. Return the result slice preserving discovery order.

### Key Types

- **`Order`** (`internal/orders/order.go`): The parsed
  order definition. Fields: Name, Description, Formula, Exec, Trigger,
  Interval, Schedule, Check, On, Pool, Timeout, Enabled, Source, Rig.

- **`TriggerResult`** (`internal/orders/triggers.go`): The outcome of a
  trigger check. Fields: Due (bool), Reason (human-readable), LastRun
  (time.Time).

- **`orderDispatcher`** (`cmd/gc/order_dispatch.go`): Interface
  with a single method `dispatch(ctx, cityPath, now)`. Production
  implementation is `memoryOrderDispatcher`.

- **`memoryOrderDispatcher`** (`cmd/gc/order_dispatch.go`):
  Holds the scanned order list, bead store, events provider, command
  runner, exec runner, events recorder, stderr writer, and max timeout.

- **`ExecRunner`** (`cmd/gc/order_dispatch.go`): Function type
  `func(ctx, command, dir string, env []string) ([]byte, error)` for
  running shell commands. Production implementation `shellExecRunner`
  uses `os/exec`.

## Invariants

These properties must hold for the order subsystem to be correct.
Violations indicate bugs.

- **Formula XOR Exec**: Every order has exactly one of `formula` or
  `exec` set. `Validate()` rejects orders with both or neither.

- **Exec orders have no pool**: An exec order runs a shell
  script directly on the controller. It has no agent pipeline and
  therefore no pool. `Validate()` rejects `exec` + `pool` combinations.

- **Trigger type requires matching parameters**: A `cooldown` trigger requires
  `interval`, a `cron` trigger requires `schedule`, a `condition` trigger
  requires `check`, an `event` trigger requires `on`. `Validate()` enforces
  these per-trigger-type constraints.

- **Tracking beads are created before dispatch goroutines**: The tracking
  bead (labeled `order-run:<scopedName>`) is created synchronously
  in the main dispatch loop. This prevents the cooldown trigger from
  re-firing on the next lane pass while the dispatch goroutine is
  still running.

- **ScopedName provides rig isolation**: The same order name
  deployed to multiple rigs produces independent scoped names (e.g.,
  `dolt-health:rig:rig-a` vs `dolt-health:rig:rig-b`). Cooldown
  tracking, event cursors, and history queries all use ScopedName.
  Firing one rig's order does not affect another rig's trigger
  evaluation.

- **Higher-priority layers override lower by name**: When the same
  order subdirectory name exists in multiple formula layers,
  `Scan()` uses the definition from the highest-priority layer (last in
  the layers slice). The override is total (the entire TOML definition
  replaces the lower one).

- **Manual triggers never auto-fire**: `CheckTrigger()` for a `manual` trigger
  always returns `Due: false`. Manual orders are filtered out of the
  dispatcher entirely during build. They can only be triggered via
  `gc order run`.

- **Disabled orders are excluded from scan results**: `Scan()`
  filters out orders with `enabled = false`. They do not appear in
  any CLI command output or dispatch evaluation.

- **Cron trigger fires at most once per minute**: After matching the 5-field
  schedule, `checkCron()` verifies the last run was not in the same
  truncated minute. This prevents duplicate fires within a single cron
  window.

- **Event trigger uses cursor-based deduplication**: Event orders track
  the highest processed event sequence number via `seq:<N>` labels on
  order-run beads. Formula orders stamp the wisp root or failure tracking
  bead; exec orders stamp the tracking bead before the command runs. Subsequent
  trigger checks use `AfterSeq` filtering to avoid reprocessing
  already-handled events.

- **Dispatch goroutines are drained on controller exit**: Each due
  order launches a goroutine whose completion is tracked by an
  in-flight counter and channel signal on the dispatcher. Controller
  shutdown and config reload call `orderDispatcher.drain(ctx)` with
  a bounded timeout so tracking bead outcomes and `order.failed` /
  `order.completed` events are persisted before the dispatcher is
  discarded. Reload retains any dispatcher that does not drain before
  its timeout and drains it again during controller shutdown. Failed
  orders emit `order.failed` events but do not retry; the tracking
  bead prevents re-fire within the same cooldown window.

- **No role names in Go code**: The order subsystem operates on
  config-driven pool names and formula references. No line of Go
  references a specific role name.

## Interactions

| Depends on | How |
|---|---|
| `internal/config` | `OrdersConfig` for skip list and max timeout. `FormulaLayers` for formula directory resolution. `City` struct for config access. |
| `internal/events` | `Recorder` for emitting `order.fired`, `order.completed`, `order.failed` events. `Provider` for event trigger queries (`List` with `AfterSeq` filtering). |
| `internal/beads` | `Store` for creating tracking beads, querying last-run history (`ListByLabel`), and instantiating wisps (`MolCook`). `CommandRunner` for bd CLI invocation. |
| `internal/fsys` | `FS` interface for filesystem abstraction in `Scan()` (enables fake filesystem in tests). `OSFS` for production. |

| Depended on by | How |
|---|---|
| `cmd/gc/city_runtime.go` | The controller builds the order dispatcher on startup and config reload and hands it to the orders lane (`cmd/gc/orders_lane.go`), which calls `dispatch()` on each lane pass. Each tick wakes the lane instead of dispatching. |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_order.go` | CLI commands (`gc order list/show/run/check/history`) use `orders.Scan()` and `orders.CheckTrigger()` for user-facing operations. |
| Health Patrol (`cmd/gc/`) | Order dispatch is not a tick phase. The tick wakes the orders lane; the lane dispatches on its own goroutine, paced by its duty cycle and a patrol-interval backstop. |

## Code Map

| File | Responsibility |

| `internal/orders/order.go` | `Order` struct, `Parse()`, `Validate()`, `IsEnabled()`, `IsExec()`, `TimeoutOrDefault()`, `ScopedName()` |
| `internal/orders/triggers.go` | `TriggerResult`, `CheckTrigger()`, `checkCooldown()`, `checkCron()`, `checkCondition()`, `checkEvent()`, `cronFieldMatches()`, `MaxSeqFromLabels()` |
| `internal/orders/scanner.go` | `Scan()` -- discovers orders across formula layers with priority override |
| `cmd/gc/orders_lane.go` | The orders lane: duty-cycle wake pacing and backstop timer, `runOrdersLanePass()`, the FS-pressure gate, dispatcher staging and install, the order-set generation guard |
| `cmd/gc/order_dispatch.go` | `orderDispatcher` interface, `memoryOrderDispatcher`, `buildOrderDispatcher()`, `dispatch()`, `dispatchOne()`, `dispatchExec()`, `dispatchWisp()`, `effectiveTimeout()`, `rigExclusiveLayers()`, `qualifyPool()`, `ExecRunner`, `shellExecRunner` |

## Configuration

Orders are defined as `order.toml` files inside formula
directories following the structure
`<formulaDir>/orders/<name>/order.toml`. The `[orders]`
section in `city.toml` controls global order behavior.

### order.toml (per-order definition)

```toml
[order]
description = "Check database health"
formula = "mol-db-health"        # dispatch action (XOR with exec)
# exec = "scripts/check-db.sh"   # alternative: shell script dispatch
trigger = "cooldown"                # cooldown | cron | condition | event | manual
interval = "5m"                  # required for cooldown trigger
# schedule = "0 3 * * *"         # required for cron trigger (5-field)
# check = "test -f /tmp/flag"    # required for condition trigger
# on = "bead.closed"             # required for event trigger
pool = "worker"                  # target pool for formula dispatch (optional)
timeout = "90s"                  # per-order timeout (optional)
enabled = true                   # default: true
```

### city.toml (global settings)

```toml
[orders]
skip = ["noisy-order"]      # order names to exclude from scanning
max_timeout = "120s"             # hard cap on per-order timeout (default: uncapped)
```

### Order layering (override priority, lowest to highest)

The formula layer order determines which `order.toml` wins when the
same order name exists in multiple layers:

1. **City pack formulas** -- from pack referenced in `city.toml`
2. **City local formulas** -- from `[formulas]` section or `.gc/formulas/`
3. **Rig pack formulas** -- from pack applied to a specific rig
4. **Rig local formulas** -- from rig's `formulas_dir`

A higher-numbered layer completely replaces a lower-numbered layer's
definition for the same order name. This enables packs to
define defaults that operators override locally.

### Rig-scoped orders

When a rig has rig-exclusive formula layers (layers beyond the city
prefix), orders found in those layers are stamped with the rig
name. This produces independent scoped tracking:

- Same order deployed to rigs `rig-a` and `rig-b` tracks
  independently as `db-health:rig:rig-a` and `db-health:rig:rig-b`.
- Pool names are auto-qualified: `pool = "worker"` in rig `demo-repo`
  becomes `pool:demo-repo/worker` on the wisp label. Already-qualified
  names (containing `/`) are left unchanged.

## Testing

The order subsystem has comprehensive unit tests across three test
files in the library and two in the CLI:

| Test file | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `internal/orders/automation_test.go` | Parse (formula, exec, event orders), Validate (all trigger types, mutual exclusion, missing fields, timeout validation), IsEnabled default/explicit, IsExec, TimeoutOrDefault (defaults and custom), ScopedName (city and rig) |
| `internal/orders/triggers_test.go` | CheckTrigger for all five trigger types: cooldown (never run, due, not due), cron (matched, not matched, already run this minute), condition (pass, fail), event (due, with cursor, cursor past all, not due, nil provider), rig-scoped triggers (cooldown, cron, event use ScopedName), MaxSeqFromLabels (various label configurations) |
| `internal/orders/scanner_test.go` | Scan (basic discovery, empty layers, layer override priority, skip list, disabled filtering, source path recording) |
| `cmd/gc/order_dispatch_test.go` | Dispatcher nil-guard (no orders, manual-only), cooldown dispatch (due, not due, multiple), exec dispatch (due, failure, cooldown, ORDER_DIR env, timeout), rig-scoped dispatch (rig stamping, independent cooldown, qualified pool), rigExclusiveLayers, qualifyPool, effectiveTimeout (default, custom, capped) |

All tests use in-memory fakes (`fsys.NewFake()`, `beads.NewMemStore()`,
stubbed `ExecRunner`, `memRecorder`) with no external infrastructure
dependencies. Condition trigger tests use real `sh -c true` and `sh -c false`
commands. See `TESTING.md` for the overall testing philosophy and tier
boundaries.

## Known Limitations

- **No retry on dispatch failure**: Failed orders emit events but
  are not retried. The tracking bead prevents re-fire within the same
  cooldown window, so a failed order must wait for the next trigger
  opening.

- **Cron granularity is minutes**: The cron trigger operates at
  minute-level granularity with simple field matching (`*`, exact
  integer, comma-separated values). It does not support ranges (`1-5`),
  steps (`*/5`), or sub-minute scheduling.

- **Condition trigger blocks the dispatch loop**: `checkCondition()` runs
  `sh -c <check>` synchronously during trigger evaluation. A slow check
  command blocks evaluation of subsequent orders on that lane pass.

- **Event trigger cursor is per-run, not per-dispatch**: The cursor
  position is computed from `seq:<N>` labels on existing order-run beads via
  `MaxSeqFromLabels()`. The controller and `gc order run` fail closed when the
  current event head cannot be read. For side-effecting exec orders, the cursor
  is persisted before the command runs so a crash after execution does not
  replay the same event. Trade-off: a controller crash after the cursor stamp
  and before exec start drops that event for idempotent exec orders; for
  non-idempotent exec orders this is the safer failure mode.

- **No hot-add of orders**: Order discovery runs on controller
  start and config reload (via fsnotify). Adding a new
  `order.toml` file requires the config directory watcher to
  trigger a reload; adding a new formula layer directory requires a
  `city.toml` change.

- **Fire-and-forget goroutines**: Dispatch goroutines are not tracked
  by the controller. On shutdown, in-flight dispatches may be
  interrupted mid-execution if the context is canceled.
