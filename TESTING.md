# Gas City Testing Policy

This file is the canonical, normative source for how Gas City tests are
designed, placed, reviewed, and timed. If an older plan, audit, or contributor
document conflicts with this policy, this file wins. Existing exceptions are
debt, not precedent. In this document, an **owner** is a tracking bead with a
current assignee. An approved waiver must also name its reason, replacement
proof, and expiry.

The
[testing efficiency operating corpus](engdocs/contributors/testing-efficiency-workflow-corpus.md)
is the non-normative workflow, evidence catalog, and team handoff for applying
this policy.

### Policy versus enforcement today

The rules below are normative even where automation is still being built. Do
not describe a target as an existing gate.

| Policy area | Mechanical status today |
|---|---|
| Sleep/process/listener/tmux/env/CWD growth | Checked by the source-resource ledger below |
| Runtime constructor and `runtime.Fake` conformance binding | Checked by the runtime provider ledger below; several explicit waivers remain |
| Other provider conformance | Shared suites exist, but exact production-constructor coverage is still a manual audit with known gaps |
| Sub-five-minute PR feedback and timing ratchets | Target; current Go timing artifacts measure test execution, not workflow queue/bootstrap/graph time (`ga-80po0c.4`) |
| Large/E2E ownership and cadence | Target; the executable manifest is owned by `ga-80po0c.6` |
| First-attempt flake and quarantine policy | Target; required Playwright retry and legacy unledgered skips remain noncompliant debt under `ga-80po0c` |

## Building and testing: Bazel is the gate

Bazel is how Gas City is built and tested. CI gates on `bazel test`
(`.github/workflows/bazel.yml`): its lanes run every Go test, nogo (go
vet's analyzers plus the linters `.golangci.yml` enables), formatting,
generated-artifact drift and the repo-policy guards as Bazel targets on
rbe-west. The policy in the rest of this file applies to tests however they
are run; Bazel is the runner that enforces it.

| Tier | CI lane | Command | `make` alias |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit, nogo, format, generated artifacts, policy | `unit` | `bazel test //...` | `make test` (`make check` adds the shell guards) |
| Acceptance Tier A | `acceptance` (sharded) | `bazel test --config=acceptance //test/acceptance:acceptance_test` | `make test-acceptance` |
| Integration-tagged packages outside `test/integration` | `integration-packages` (gating) | `bazel test --config=integration //test:integration_packages` | part of `make test-integration` |
| `test/integration` | `integration` (evidence-only) | `bazel test --config=integration //test/integration:integration_test` | part of `make test-integration` |
| Docs sync | `unit` | `bazel test //test/docsync:docsync_test` | `make check-docs` |
| Coverage (push to main) | `coverage` | `bazel coverage //... --combined_report=lcov` | none |

Narrow while iterating: `bazel test //internal/config:config_test`, or
`bazel test //internal/beads/...` for a subtree;
`--test_filter=TestName` selects tests inside a target. The CI lanes add
`--config=ci` (result policy and scheduling only, no action-key change:
tests start beside nogo rather than after it) and the per-run
transport config. Passing `--config=acceptance` or `--config=integration`
matters: they set the `gotags` define, the timeout and, for integration,
`GC_FAST_UNIT=0`, exactly as the lanes do (`.bazelrc`).

**Where actions run** (details in "Bazel cache tiers" below):

- **Contributors:** `--config=fork-cache` reads rbe-west's anonymous,
  read-only cache, so anything CI already ran is a hit; misses build and run
  on your machine, nothing is uploaded, no credential is needed.
- **Maintainers:** `--config=remote-exec` with an rbe-west mTLS client
  certificate executes on rbe-west's `oss` pool.
- **Agent hosts:** the operator's `~/.bazelrc` names the executor and
  certificate, so plain `bazel test` executes remotely; whole-repo `go
  test` fan-out on a shared host is never the right tool.

Put `build --config=fork-cache` or `build --config=remote-exec` in the
gitignored `.bazelrc.local` to make it your default, or pass it per command
(`make test BAZEL_FLAGS=--config=fork-cache`). After changing imports or
adding packages or files, run `make bazel-sync` and commit the regenerated
BUILD files (the `BUILD files in sync` gate checks this). See
`engdocs/bazel-quickstart.md` for setup and `engdocs/bazel-ci-budget.md` for
the CI optimization loop.

**Plain `go test` is an inner-loop convenience, not the gate.** `go test
./internal/config -run TestX` is fine for a quick edit-compile-run cycle on
one package. It runs none of the nogo, format, generated-artifact or policy
targets, uses your host's environment instead of the pinned one, and a pass
there is not evidence for CI. The Go-native make targets (`make test-go`,
`make check-go`, `make test-acceptance-go`, `make test-integration-go`,
`make check-docs-go`, and the sharded runners under "Cross-category runners"
below) exist for offline work and for hosts Bazel does not serve, such as
the macOS jobs. Workflow jobs that still run a Go-native suite call these
`-go` names explicitly, so each workflow says which engine it uses.

`//go:build integration` tests outside `test/integration` run in the
`integration-packages` lane, the Bazel form of `go test -tags integration`
with `GC_FAST_UNIT=0`:

```bash
bazel test --config=integration //test:integration_packages
bazel test --config=integration //internal/runtime/tmux:tmux_test
```

`//test/integration` itself gates only through the `integration-smoke`
lane (`bazel test --config=integration-smoke //test/integration:integration_test`):
the bdstore and REST smoke tests `scripts/test-integration-shard` names. The
full suite runs evidence-only on pushes until its flaky tests are fixed.

`make bazel-sync` lists every package with an integration-tagged file (or a
`GC_FAST_UNIT=0` process gate) in that suite. Tools those tests run by name
come from pinned data deps, not the host: a go_test passes their
`$(rootpath)`s in `GC_TEST_TOOL_PATHS` (prepended to `PATH` by
`internal/testenv`), and Bazel-built helper binaries by `$(rootpath)` in an
env var the test reads with `bazeltest.DataPath` instead of `go build`.

### Nightly fresh test run

`bazel-nightly.yml` passes `fresh-test-results: true` to every `bazel.yml`
lane it runs, which appends `--config=fresh` (`.bazelrc`:
`--nocache_test_results`) to each lane's `bazel test`. This exists because
`tools/rbe/worker-env` keys `git` and `yq` at major version only: a minor
upgrade of either tool on the rbe-west workers moves no action key, so a PR
or push run reuses its cached `PASS` forever and a regression that upgrade
introduced never shows up (the 2026-10-07 worker-env outage review). The
nightly run re-executes every test once a day instead, exercising the real
worker toolchain, exactly as beads' nightly does
(`gastownhall/beads` `.bazelrc`'s `test:fresh`). It still writes the shared
remote cache: `--nocache_test_results` only skips reading a cached result,
and rbe-west's workers upload their own results regardless of this flag.
Run the same thing locally with:

```bash
bazel test //... --config=fresh
```

### Merge queue

The required-check workflows are merge-queue ready but the queue is off: it
starts working only when a maintainer adds a `merge_queue` rule to the main
ruleset. `bazel.yml`, `ci.yml` and `codeql.yml` run on
`merge_group: [checks_requested]`, so every required check reports on a
queue entry's merge-group commit: `Check` and `CI / required` (`ci.yml`),
the four `Analyze (...)` (`codeql.yml`, which also feeds the ruleset's
`code_scanning` rule), `bazel test (side-by-side)` and `BUILD files in sync`
(`bazel.yml`). `scripts/ci_merge_queue_test.go` pins this:

- **Same-repo trust.** A merge group has no `github.event.pull_request`, so
  the `rbe` job takes the same-repo path (mode `remote`, no mint), whoever
  queued the entry. Every expression in the three workflows that reads the
  event is listed in the test with its `merge_group` value. A new one fails
  the test until someone checks that value.
- **The tested tree is the queue ref.** `fresh-merge` and the `rbe` job's
  `base` step run on `pull_request` only, because the merge-group commit is
  already the merge. The OpenAPI breaking-change gate compares the spec
  against `merge_group.base_sha`, the commit the entry is queued onto (main
  or the entry ahead of it). `ci.yml`'s path filter diffs `base_sha` to
  `head_sha`, which is the entry's own change, as on a PR.
- **Queue runs are never canceled.** `bazel.yml` and `ci.yml` key a merge
  group's concurrency group on its own `gh-readonly-queue/*` ref, which is
  unique per entry and base, with `cancel-in-progress` false. A PR's runs,
  keyed on its number, never share a queue entry's group.
- **The lanes match a PR's.** Unit, acceptance, integration-packages and
  integration-smoke run, and a queue run reuses cached test results like
  any other run. The `integration` lane can later be gated on `merge_group`
  only (G3).

**Recommended queue settings** (for 60-70 merges a day, with a peak of 7 an
hour from 2026-10-05 to 10-07). A queue run costs about what a push run
does, 6-10 minutes, so 4 parallel builds clear about 24 entries an hour:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Merge method | `SQUASH` | The ruleset allows merge and squash; `main` history is squash-shaped |
| Grouping strategy | `ALLGREEN` | Every group's checks must pass; a red entry is ejected, not merged with the rest |
| Build concurrency (`max_entries_to_build`) | 4 | About 3x the hourly peak. Each entry runs 4 remote lanes, so going higher mostly adds rbe-west load |
| Group size (`max_entries_to_merge`) | 5 | Bursts merge together |
| `min_entries_to_merge` / wait | 1 / 5 min | Never wait for a batch (the wait is inert at 1) |
| Status check timeout (`check_response_timeout_minutes`) | 60 | A cold rbe-west scale-up plus a queued Windows job can pass 30 minutes; a timeout ejects the entry and rebuilds everything behind it |
| Required checks | the ruleset's 7 contexts, unchanged | Classic branch protection keeps `CI / required`, which also reports on `merge_group` |

Repository auto-merge is already on, so `gh pr merge --auto` queues a PR.
After enabling the queue, watch the first day's `merge_group` run times, then
adjust the build concurrency.

**Security.** A queue run executes the queued commit's own workflows with
CI secrets, including the rbe-west executor credentials. Queueing a fork PR
is therefore the same trust decision as merging it. Review a fork PR's
changes to `.github/**`, `.bazelrc`, `tools/**`, `MODULE.bazel` and BUILD
files before you queue it.

### Measuring cache hits (BEP cache report)

To check whether a run actually reused results, write a Build Event
Protocol file and summarize it:

```bash
bazel test //... --build_event_json_file=/var/tmp/bep-unit.json
go run ./scripts/bazel-bep-summary.go --context local unit=/var/tmp/bep-unit.json
```

The report counts test targets as **cached** (local action cache, remote
cache, or disk cache; bazel's `(cached) PASSED`) or **executed** (remote
executor or a local strategy), gives passed/flaky/failed totals, the hit
rate, test time run versus skipped, the action-level runner counts
(`remote cache hit`, `remote`, `linux-sandbox`, ...) and the slowest
executed tests. Pass one `PHASE=FILE` per invocation; `--json-out PATH`
writes the machine-readable report (schema 1), `--allow-missing` shows an
absent file as "no BEP file" instead of failing, and `--top N` sizes the
slowest list. In CI, each `bazel.yml` lane (unit, acceptance,
integration-packages, integration-smoke, integration) uploads its BEP file, redacted to the fields the report reads
(`internal/testpolicy/bepsummary/redact.jq`: a raw BEP file holds the
expanded command line, including `--remote_executor`), and the
`bazel / test cache report` job reports them in one table in its job
summary (one phase per lane, context `<event>/<mode>`) and uploads the JSON
as `bazel-yml-bep-summary-<attempt>`, so hit rates can be compared across
pre-push, PR, and main runs. `scripts/bazel_bep_summary_workflow_test.go`
fails if a `bazel test` runs outside the lanes or a lane stops writing a
BEP file the report reads.

### Bazel cache tiers

A result is reused only by a run that hashes the action identically, so
every flag that can change an action key is committed, unconditionally, in
`.bazelrc` (notably the pinned test `PATH`, with Go at `/usr/local/go`). The
per-mode configs and the gitignored `.bazelrc.local` carry transport only:
endpoints, credentials, timeouts, download and parallelism policy.
`scripts/bazel_key_parity_test.go` enforces this, including against the rc
`setup-bazel` writes and the lines `bazel.yml`'s lanes add to
`.bazelrc.local`, so pre-push, PR and main runs compute the same keys.

| tier | how | executes | writes the shared cache |
|---|---|---|---|
| contributor (default) | `--config=fork-cache` | locally, on cache misses | never |
| maintainer (opt-in, allowlisted; not live yet) | `--config=remote-exec` + a client certificate | rbe-west, `oss` instance | only rbe-west's own workers |
| CI (`bazel.yml`) | `--config=remote-exec` + CI secrets | rbe-west, `oss` instance | only rbe-west's own workers |

- **Contributor.** `fork-cache` reads rbe-west's anonymous, read-only cache
  (`rbe-cache.ops.gascity.com:8443`, instance `oss`): anything CI already ran
  for the same inputs is a hit, misses run on your machine, and nothing is
  ever uploaded. If the endpoint is closed or slow, Bazel falls back to local
  execution. No credential, no remote compute.
- **Maintainer.** *Not live yet; rbe-west will announce go-live.* Until
  then nothing below works, and pre-push uses the contributor tier. Remote
  execution is opt-in and needs an mTLS client certificate for rbe-west's
  maintainer endpoint; without one nothing tries to execute remotely. Use
  it for gastownhall OSS repositories only (gascity, beads): everything it
  runs lands in the `oss` action cache, which anyone can read anonymously
  by digest, and the Blacksmith-donated pool serves OSS work only. Never
  point it at a private repository. There is no self-service path in this
  repo (the `rbe-fork` mint used by
  `.github/actions/setup-bazel/fork-credential.sh` certifies only
  in-progress PR runs): an rbe-west operator signs your
  certificate (infra `nativelink-cas/west`, README "rbe-maint").

  Your GitHub account must be on `.github/rbe-fork-allowlist.txt` (its
  numeric id, with the login as the comment), the allowlist the fork mint
  uses for read/write PR runs. Because a CSR can name any login, rbe-west
  signs one only with proof from the account it names: an SSH signature,
  made with a key on your GitHub account, over your login, a hash of the
  CSR's public key and today's date (UTC). Use any SSH key listed at `https://github.com/<login>.keys`
  (or one of your account's SSH signing keys); a hardware key or ssh-agent
  works too (`-f` takes the public key file then). Generate the TLS key
  locally (it never leaves your machine):

  ```bash
  L=<your-github-login>   # exactly as on your GitHub profile, case included
  S=~/.ssh/id_ed25519     # a key whose public half is on github.com/$L.keys
  install -d -m 0700 ~/.config/rbe && cd ~/.config/rbe
  # PKCS#8 EC key: Bazel's Netty TLS refuses a SEC1 "EC PRIVATE KEY".
  openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -out rbe-maint.key
  chmod 600 rbe-maint.key
  head -1 rbe-maint.key   # -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- (PKCS#8)
  # Exactly these two RDNs: CN = your login, O = gascity-maintainers.
  openssl req -new -key rbe-maint.key -subj "/CN=$L/O=gascity-maintainers" -out rbe-maint.csr
  # The proof: sign "login + sha256 of the CSR's public key + today (UTC)" with your GitHub SSH key.
  spki=$(openssl req -in rbe-maint.csr -noout -pubkey | openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 | awk '{print $NF}')
  date=$(date -u +%F)
  printf 'rbe-maint-csr v2\ncn=%s\nspki-sha256=%s\ndate=%s\n' "$L" "$spki" "$date" >rbe-maint.csr.msg
  ssh-keygen -Y sign -n rbe-maint-csr -f "$S" rbe-maint.csr.msg   # writes rbe-maint.csr.msg.sig
  ```

  Send `rbe-maint.csr` and `rbe-maint.csr.msg.sig` to an rbe-west operator.
  Both are public, and the operator trusts the signature, not the channel:
  rbe-west checks it against the keys GitHub publishes for your login and
  refuses the CSR if it does not verify (the refusal shows the exact text
  the signature must cover). The signature is dated, so it is accepted
  only within 3 days of the date it names: if the operator signs later,
  run the last three commands again (same key and CSR) and send the new
  `.sig`. An undated signature from an earlier version of these commands
  (`rbe-maint-csr v1`) is refused. Never send `rbe-maint.key`. The commands
  work with OpenSSH 8.1 or later and with macOS's LibreSSL `openssl`.

  You get back `rbe-maint.crt` (save it as `~/.config/rbe/rbe-maint.crt`):
  client-auth only, valid for 90 days, pinned on the farm by its
  fingerprint. It works only on the maintainer endpoint, only for instance
  `oss`, and it never writes the cache: results are written by rbe-west's
  workers alone. Then add to `.bazelrc.local` (absolute paths; nothing else
  belongs there):

  ```
  build:remote-exec --remote_executor=grpcs://rbe-maint.ops.gascity.com:8445
  build:remote-exec --remote_instance_name=oss
  build:remote-exec --tls_client_certificate=/home/<you>/.config/rbe/rbe-maint.crt
  build:remote-exec --tls_client_key=/home/<you>/.config/rbe/rbe-maint.key
  ```

  The endpoint serves a public Let's Encrypt certificate, so no
  `--tls_certificate` line. **Never set `--remote_cache_compression`** for
  it, in `.bazelrc.local` or any other rc: the maintainer endpoint does not
  advertise zstd, and Bazel refuses a remote that doesn't. Do not add
  `--remote_execution_priority` either. `--remote_cache` defaults to the
  executor, and the other transport flags come from `.bazelrc`'s
  `build:remote-exec`.

  An operator can revoke a certificate at any time: its new requests then
  fail with `UNAUTHENTICATED`. Revoking a certificate revokes its key:
  every certificate on that key stops working, and the key is never
  certified again. It is also revoked within the hour once your account
  leaves the allowlist. To renew, make a new key, CSR and signature (the
  same commands) before day 90. You may hold at most two live
  certificates, so you can switch without a gap; the same key is
  re-certified only in the last 14 days of its certificate, with a fresh
  signature. Once a certificate has expired, its key is never certified
  again: make a new key. If your key leaks, tell an operator.

  Allowlisted maintainers working on this OSS project run on the
  Blacksmith-donated OSS pool (`--remote_instance_name=oss`). Their actions
  land in the `oss` action cache that CI and contributors read, so a
  pre-push result is a PR and main hit. Pre-push executes remotely only on
  main's current `worker-env` pin (see **Pre-push** below).
- **CI.** `bazel.yml` is the trusted writer: its actions execute on
  rbe-west's `oss` workers, which alone write the `oss` action cache that
  contributors and fork PRs read. Fork PRs get `rbe-fork` remote execution
  with a certificate minted for that run, or, when the mint is closed or
  refuses, the read-only cache with execution on the runner; either way
  every lane runs and gates.

**Pre-push.** `.githooks/pre-push` runs the suite through
`.githooks/lib/push-suite.sh` when a push changes Go sources. Mode by
`GC_PREPUSH_SUITE` (default `auto`):

| `GC_PREPUSH_SUITE` | runs |
|---|---|
| `auto` | `bazel test //... --config=remote-exec` when any rc file Bazel reads names a remote executor and the checkout's `worker-env` pin is current; `bazel test //... --config=fork-cache` otherwise; `make test-fast-parallel` when bazel is not installed, or for `fork-cache` when the pinned test `PATH` has no `go` |
| `rbe` | `bazel test //... --config=remote-exec`; fails when no rc file names an executor or the `worker-env` pin is not current |
| `cache` | `bazel test //... --config=fork-cache` |
| `go` | `make test-fast-parallel` (plain `go test`, the pre-Bazel suite), behind a banner saying it is not what CI enforces |

Whenever the push runs `make test-fast-parallel` instead of Bazel, whether
by `auto`'s fallback or an explicit `go`, it prints a banner with the reason
and the fix, and says CI runs `bazel test //...`: a push that passes the go
suite can still fail nogo, formatting or a generated-artifact target.

`auto` asks Bazel which options its rc files set (`bazel info --announce_rc
--config=remote-exec`, which contacts no remote): a non-empty
`--remote_executor` in the system rc, the workspace rc with `.bazelrc.local`
(a maintainer's `build:remote-exec` lines), or `~/.bazelrc` selects
`remote-exec`. Agent hosts whose `~/.bazelrc` sets `build
--remote_executor=...` with the operator certificate therefore push with
remote execution: compiles and tests run on rbe-west, and the host only
analyzes, which keeps `go test` fan-out off shared machines.
`--config=remote-exec` adds transport only on top of such an rc (minimal
downloads, `--jobs=64`, a long timeout, no uploads of local results), so
actions hash like CI's. An explicit `rbe`/`cache` without bazel installed,
`rbe` with no executor in any rc (the suite would build and run locally at
`--jobs=64`), an option set Bazel cannot read, or an unknown value fails the
push. `fork-cache` resets `--remote_executor`, so the cache mode never
executes remotely. Locally
executed tests use the pinned test `PATH`, so Go must be at `/usr/local/go`
(`sudo ln -s "$(go env GOROOT)" /usr/local/go`; without it `auto` runs
`make test-fast-parallel` instead of the cache mode); overriding
`--test_env=PATH` in `.bazelrc.local` works but gives your machine its own
action keys, so nothing CI ran is a hit.

**Stale `worker-env` pin.** Every remote action requests
`//platforms:rbe_worker`'s `worker-env` pin, and rbe-west's workers
advertise only the pin on main ("Re-pinning the RBE worker host" below).
A branch that predates a re-pin, or that moves the pin itself, would queue
every remote action forever while the pool scaler starts Blacksmith VMs
that cannot take them. So before executing remotely, `push-suite.sh`
fetches main (bounded to 30s, no prompts) from the remote whose URL is
`github.com/gastownhall/gascity` (`origin`, then `upstream`, then any other;
`origin` if none is; `GC_PREPUSH_MAIN_REMOTE` names it explicitly), so a
fork's stale main never stands in for gascity's. Offline it uses that
remote's last fetched `main`. It compares the checkout's pin with main's
(`tools/rbe/worker-env-drift pin`). When that remote is on GitHub and `gh`
is installed, it also runs `worker-env-drift preflight` (bounded to 20s,
best effort: a failed lookup only warns) to
find an open `rbe-worker-env-drift` issue for main's pin, which means no
live worker serves even main. On a pin that differs from main's, no
readable main, or an open drift issue, `auto` prints why and runs the
non-remote mode instead (`fork-cache`, or `make test-fast-parallel` by the
rules above), and `rbe` fails the push. Rebase onto main to execute
remotely again; a change that moves the pin runs its remote suite in CI
after it merges, as `bazel.yml`'s own preflight does.

### Re-pinning the RBE worker host

Every action's key carries `worker-env`, the sha256 of
`tools/rbe/worker-env.txt` (`//platforms:rbe_worker`). That file is the
toolchain manifest of the Blacksmith host the pool workers run on. rbe-west's
oss and oss-fork schedulers match `worker-env` exactly. The default instance
ignores it. Each worker advertises the hash of the host it measures
(`tools/rbe/worker-env`). An action runs only on a worker whose toolchain
is the pinned one. gastownhall/beads shares the pools and carries a
byte-identical copy of the manifest and the same pin.

The manifest records what can change an action's result, and nothing else.
We don't control the Blacksmith image, and it takes Ubuntu security updates
on its own schedule:

- **Kept in full:** the arch, the OS release (`ubuntu 24.04`), and the Go
  and dolt the worker installs by checksum.
- **Kept as the upstream release:** each measured package
  (`tools/rbe/worker-env`'s `measured` list). The Debian epoch and the
  Ubuntu revision are dropped, so `9.4-3ubuntu6.1` and `9.4-3ubuntu6.2`
  both measure `9.4`.
  - The libraries the hermetic toolchain and test binaries load (glibc,
    libstdc++, libgcc_s, ICU, zlib, libxml2, liblzma) are cut to
    major.minor, their ABI.
  - The tools that tests, genrules and test wrappers run (bash, dash,
    coreutils, python3, tmux, jq, ...) are cut to major.minor too. The
    archive holds that fixed for a release.
  - git comes from the git-core PPA, which ships every upstream minor as a
    security update, so it is cut to its major.
  - yq is not a dpkg package; it is measured from `yq --version` and cut
    to its major.
- **Not measured:** the kernel; the `-dev` headers and cmake (no action
  reads host headers or runs cmake); and every other image package.

So a glibc minor, another arch or OS release, a library or archive tool
minor, a git or yq major, or a Go or dolt bump is a new manifest. A
security patch of the same releases is not. The measurement changes with
an image refresh only when the refresh changes one of those.
`tools/rbe/worker-env --raw` prints dpkg's versions as installed. That
listing is for diagnosis and is never hashed. When the measurement does
change, that is drift, and it is loud (`tools/rbe/worker-env-drift`):

- A drifted worker still registers, advertising the hash it measured.
  Actions that send no `worker-env` still run on it. Actions that carry
  the pin (gascity's and beads') never match it.
- The pool run's measurement step fails. The step summary has the diff,
  the manifest and pin to commit, and the raw listing. The worker keeps
  serving. The run's `await-drift` and `report-drift` jobs open or update
  the GitHub issue labelled `rbe-worker-env-drift`, titled
  `rbe worker-env drift: <pin>`.
- That issue is the farm's signal too. While any open
  `rbe-worker-env-drift` issue exists, each rbe-west pool scaler caps
  its pool at `NLPOOL_DRIFT_MAX_WORKERS` (default 2), so the unmatched
  queue can't drive the pool to 16 VMs. Keep that label, and keep the
  issue open until the re-pin lands.
- While the issue is open, remote `bazel.yml` runs on its pin fail at
  their preflight instead of queueing.
- `rbe-worker-env-canary.yml` measures a Blacksmith runner every six
  hours, so drift usually opens the issue before CI meets it.
- A change to the worker host (`tools/rbe/worker-env*`,
  `blacksmith-worker.sh`, `platforms/BUILD.bazel`) is measured on the
  Blacksmith image in bazel.yml's `bazel / unit` lane, which the required
  `bazel test (side-by-side)` gate fans in. If the PR's manifest is not
  what that image measures, the lane fails.

To re-pin, anyone with write access:

1. Take the manifest and pin line from the drift issue, or from the
   failed run's step summary.
2. Commit the manifest as `tools/rbe/worker-env.txt` and the pin in
   `platforms/BUILD.bazel`. `go test ./scripts/ -run RBEWorkerEnv`
   checks that they agree with each other, `go.mod` and the toolset.
   Make the same change in gastownhall/beads (its
   `tools/rbe/worker-env.txt`, byte for byte, and its pin). Merge both
   together: once the pool workers serve the new pin, beads' actions on
   the old pin don't schedule.
3. Open the PR. Pool workers run the default branch's provisioning, so
   the new pin isn't reliably served before it merges, and every
   bazel.yml lane skips the remote suite. The unit lane measures its own
   Blacksmith host against the new manifest instead, and fails if they
   differ.
4. Merge. The canary runs on the merge and closes the issues of
   superseded pins, which lifts the farm's cap. Don't close the drift
   issue before the re-pin lands.

A re-pin is a new key for every action. The first runs after it miss
the cache entirely and re-execute everything on the new host, which is
the point: no result from the old host is served for the new one.

A worker that measures an earlier pin is on a stale image (the tail of
a rollout, or a rollback). It still serves, and opens no issue. If
every worker is stale, Blacksmith rolled the image back: revert the
re-pin.
If an issue stays open for the current pin while hosts match again,
close it by hand.

## The outcome: protected PR feedback in under five minutes

The developer-visible service-level objective is p95 **under five minutes**
from GitHub Actions PR-workflow creation until the required automated `CI`
summary reaches a terminal conclusion. Compare the latest 20 non-superseded
full-union runs on the same runner-policy cohort; include failed and timed-out
attempts, and exclude only obsolete-SHA concurrency cancellations. Queueing is
part of the developer-visible metric and is also reported separately. The
execution sub-budget, from the first required job entering `in_progress` until
`CI / required` completes, is p95 at most 4m30s. Current telemetry does not yet
enforce this SLO; `ga-80po0c.4` owns that gap.

The budget changes where a proof runs, never whether an important risk is
proved:

- Required PR lanes should contain fast, deterministic proofs plus the
  relevant real boundaries. Current integration routing is coarse and the
  dashboard job is unconditional; treat that as optimization debt, not the
  desired endpoint.
- Broader real-provider and full-composition proofs run on `main` when they
  cannot fit the PR budget.
- Credentialed, live-inference, cloud, and soak journeys belong in scheduled
  or explicit profile lanes. The full live-inference profile matrix is
  currently local-only; do not claim nightly coverage for it.

A slow PR test may move to a later lane only after lower layers own its branch
and error-detail matrix. The later lane must retain any unique real-composition
risk. Moving a test without that ownership map is deleting quality, not
improving feedback.

## The authoring rule: one risk, one smallest owning proof

Start with a single sentence describing the regression the test must catch.
Then put that assertion at the smallest layer that can fail for the intended
reason. A higher layer may prove wiring across a boundary, but it must not
repeat the lower layer's branch matrix.

Classify the observable promise first:

1. **Behavior promised by a provider interface?** Add the case once to its
   shared conformance suite and run that suite against every production
   implementation with distinct behavior and every reusable fast substitute.
2. **Implementation-only decision or domain transition?** Write a unit test
   next to the code.
3. **User-visible CLI parsing, output, or exit status?** Use testscript with
   fast providers.
4. **Ordering or argument plumbing between components?** Write one focused
   coordination test with recording collaborators.
5. **Real process, protocol, filesystem, database, browser, or provider
   composition?** Keep one integration or end-to-end proof for that boundary.
6. **Documentation-to-code agreement?** Put the invariant in `test/docsync`.

The question is not “where can this test be made to pass?” It is “which layer
uniquely owns this risk?” Search for an existing owner before adding a test. If
one exists, strengthen or parameterize it instead of creating another journey.
Conformance is a reusable testing pattern rather than a sixth execution tier:
one contract suite is intentionally executed against multiple implementations.

### RED, GREEN, refactor, measure

Every behavior change and bug fix follows this loop:

1. **RED:** add the smallest owning test and observe it fail for the intended
   reason. For a bug, reproduce the reported failure before changing code.
2. **GREEN:** make the narrowest production change that satisfies the test.
3. **Refactor:** improve names and boundaries, remove duplicate assertions,
   and replace expensive collaborators with proved substitutes.
   A behavior-neutral migration records a PR-description table from every
   retired assertion to its new owner and retained real-boundary proof. Before
   commit, delegate independent reviews of semantic parity, speed/resource
   policy, and repository accuracy/enforceability.
4. **Measure:** repeat the focused test and run the affected shard. Record
   before/after wall time when adding, moving, or materially changing tests.
5. **Verify the boundary:** run the focused owner plus the relevant
   conformance, coordination, or integration owner.

Never write the large end-to-end test first merely because the production code
has no seam. Refactor the code so the policy can be exercised directly, then
retain the smallest real-boundary proof that demonstrates the wiring.

## Design production code for fast proofs

Core logic receives dependencies; outer constructors choose production
implementations. Prefer an existing provider port. For one isolated side
effect, inject a function value. Introduce a new interface only when it is a
stable domain boundary **and** has at least two real implementations,
consistent with Gas City's no-premature-abstraction rule.

| Source of nondeterminism | Fast seam | Keep real coverage for |
|---|---|---|
| Bead or domain persistence | `beads.Store`, usually `beads.MemStore` in consumer tests | Store conformance and provider lifecycle |
| Wall-time/deadline decisions | Injected clock, including `clock.Fake` | The real-clock adapter, not every consumer |
| Timers, sleeps, scheduling, backoff | Injected timer/sleeper/scheduler or `testing/synctest` | The timer adapter, not every consumer |
| Asynchronous completion | Channel, callback, event watcher, or notifier | One public protocol/event-stream composition |
| Subprocess execution | Narrow executor function/interface with scripted results | Argument-to-real-binary compatibility |
| Generated IDs or randomness | Injected generator with deterministic values | Format/entropy adapter contract |
| Filesystem operations | `fsys.FS`, normally `fsys.Fake` for consumer logic | `fsys.OSFS` conformance and OS-specific semantics |

Environment variables, current working directory, global clocks, package-level
mutable state, and executable discovery belong at composition edges. Unit tests
must not need them to steer domain behavior. Use `t.TempDir()` when the real
filesystem is itself relevant; otherwise prefer `fsys.Fake`.

## Choose meaningful failure edges, not Cartesian products

Test each distinct obligation at its owner. For a typical operation, consider
only the applicable boundaries:

- invalid input or an absent required value;
- collaborator unavailable before any side effect;
- partial success requiring rollback, idempotency, or recovery;
- cancellation or deadline propagation;
- a concurrency conflict or lost-update boundary;
- serialization or protocol incompatibility;
- restart/reconnect behavior at a real provider lifecycle boundary.

Equivalence classes beat exhaustive combinations. If five commands use the
same store port, test the shared store failures in conformance, each command's
distinct response in a unit test, and one command-to-real-store composition.
Do not multiply every command by every provider by every error. Add another
combination only when it represents a different contract. An escaped
regression must first populate the missing equivalence class at the smallest
owner; retain its high-level reproduction only when the defect uniquely
depends on that composition.

## Asynchronous tests wait for facts, not elapsed time

New or modified tests must not use `time.Sleep` to wait for work to “probably”
finish, and must not add open-coded polling loops. Instead:

- expose a completion/error notification and select on it with a context;
- capture the event cursor and subscribe before triggering work, then correlate
  terminal success or failure by request/resource ID, close the subscription,
  and reread durable state;
- use a fake clock or `testing/synctest` for timers, retries, and backoff;
- use a barrier/channel to prove a goroutine reached a state before releasing
  it; and
- assert the terminal state immediately after the notification.

Polling is allowed only at a true black-box boundary that exposes no completion
signal and where adding one would change the public contract. Such polling must
use a shared helper with a context-aware ticker or bounded backoff, fail with
the last observed state, and have one named boundary owner. Busy loops and a
fixed sleep before the helper are forbidden. The deadline rule below supplies
safety timeouts; those deadlines must not determine the normal test duration.

## Test doubles and conformance are one contract

A fast substitute is trustworthy only when it is held to the same observable
contract as production. When a provider method or invariant changes:

1. change the shared conformance suite first;
2. run it against every behaviorally distinct production implementation or
   composition for that port;
3. run it against every reusable fast substitute; and
4. keep implementation-specific tests only for behavior outside the shared
   contract.

Thin aliases that add no state, transformation, or behavior may use a focused
exact-constructor wiring proof instead of repeating the full suite. The checked
runtime ledger remains authoritative for runtime compositions.

Skips do not count as conformance. A temporary incompatibility must be recorded
as an explicit waiver with a tracking-bead owner, reason, replacement proof,
and expiry. Constructor wrappers and provider compositions need coverage for the
actual production path; proving a nearby raw implementation is not
enough.

Fakes need only model observable contract behavior used by consumers. They do
not simulate implementation internals. Add recording only when call order or
arguments are themselves the contract; a stateful fake is not automatically a
spy.

## Keep the critical end-to-end portfolio deliberately small

An end-to-end test is admitted only when all of these are true:

- it protects a high-value user journey or high-blast-radius recovery path;
- the risk exists only when multiple real boundaries are composed;
- lower layers already own the branch and error-detail matrix;
- its assertions use stable public outcomes rather than internal timing;
- it has hermetic setup, targeted cleanup, actionable diagnostics, and a named
  owner; and
- its lane and measured duration fit the cadence above.

Each major effort must point to an existing critical journey or add the one
missing composition proof. It does not receive a new E2E for every acceptance
criterion. Before admitting an E2E, list the lower-layer owners it relies on
and the unique cross-boundary failure it catches. When two journeys catch the
same regression, keep the clearer and faster one.

Record the journey, unique risk, lower-layer owners, path triggers, lane,
budget, diagnostics, and owner in the checked E2E/provider manifest owned by
`ga-80po0c.6`. Until that manifest lands, put the same fields in the PR
description. On-demand coverage does not count as a release proof without a
freshness gate for the exact release SHA.

## Flakes are defects

A deterministic product-test failure may not be retried into green on the same
tested SHA. Repetition is useful for diagnosis, but a required gate must retain
the worst product-test status across attempts. A pre-test runner/service outage
may be retried only when classified with attached infrastructure evidence; it
is reported separately. A code change produces a new SHA and a new result. The
failure has one tracking-bead owner until fixed.

Quarantine is forbidden until a checked ledger exists. Any future quarantine
must include a tracking-bead owner, captured failure evidence, nonblocking
still-failing lane, replacement coverage, and expiry that fails CI;
quarantined coverage cannot satisfy a required gate. Capability-based local
skips likewise require an equipped CI execution or an explicit waiver. Do not
weaken assertions, increase sleeps, or broaden retries to hide an unknown race.
Remove redundant tests; repair unique tests.

## Timing objectives and resource ratchets

Test performance claims require evidence. For a focused change, run the test
repeatedly with the result cache disabled (for example, the command below) and
time the relevant sharded target. This is focused diagnostic evidence, not an
authoritative p95; the history format requires twenty comparable successful
samples for an authoritative p95.

```bash
go test -count=10 -run '^TestName$' ./path
```

Compare like runner, OS, architecture, CPU count, cache condition, and suite
variant. A single warm-cache run is diagnostic, not a regression baseline.

No change may knowingly push the protected graph above its SLO. Once trusted
history and workflow telemetry are authoritative, checked per-profile
baselines must fail material regressions and lower after sustained
improvements; increases require an expiring waiver. Until then, include
before/after observations in the PR and treat the timing tools below as
shard-balancing evidence rather than enforcement.

The checked source-resource ledgers below are anti-growth ratchets for sleeps,
processes, listeners, environment mutation, and CWD mutation. Reductions lower
the checked baseline; new debt requires the same explicit, expiring policy
change as any other waiver.

## Waiver expiry clocks

Two checked ledgers carry dated waivers: the runtime provider ledger
(`internal/testutil/providerledger`) and the resource census
(`internal/testpolicy/resourcecensus`). Both are untagged, both land in the
unit-core job, and that job runs in `.githooks/pre-push`. A date passing is
therefore enough on its own to turn every Go-touching push in the fleet red with
no code change involved. That happened on 2026-08-12 and again on 2026-08-26,
and both times it was cleared by whoever happened to be blocked rather than by
the waiver's owner.

**One clock.** Every dated ledger asks `internal/testpolicy/waiverclock` and
never reads `time.Now()` itself. A ledger that computes its own answer is a
second policy, and a shared expiry date drifting between two ledgers is what two
policies look like from the outside.

**Structural defects are not on the clock.** A missing owner, a malformed or
absent date, an expiry parked past the horizon ceiling — none of these can
appear without a code change, so they are fatal in every mode and belong to
whoever wrote them. The clock governs one thing: a date that passed while the
code sat still.

**Mode ownership.** `GC_WAIVER_CLOCK` selects `grace` or `strict`. Grace is the
fleet mode: it is what pre-commit, pre-push, and PR CI run, and it is what an
unset environment gets, so a lane that scrubs its environment fails safe instead
of silently strict. Strict belongs only to scheduled lanes the owner is
answerable for — `scripts/waiver-clock-audit`, reached by the nightly
`waiver-clock` job and by the maintainer city's audit order. Do not wire strict
into pre-commit, pre-push, or any PR-blocking check. That is precisely the shape
of the two incidents above.

**The timeline.** A waiver warns from 14 days before its expiry, so its owner
hears about it while there is still time to land the proof. Past the expiry it
warns for another 14 days, naming its owner in every message. Past that it is
fatal in every mode, grace included. Twenty-eight days of runway, and then the
ratchet has its teeth back — grace bounds what a bystander pays for someone
else's missed date, it does not repeal the ratchet.

**Waivers do not become permanent through inaction.** A lapse has exactly two
resolutions: land the replacement proof and delete the row, or re-date it as an
explicit policy change citing the owner bead, reviewed like any other ledger
edit. Doing neither is bounded, not stable — it ends on the fleet-fatal day the
failure message prints.

**If the clock blocks you and you are not the owner.** The message names the
owner, the fleet-fatal day, and the `bd show` that gives you context; reproduce
it with `GC_WAIVER_CLOCK=strict`. Once a lapse is fleet-fatal, anyone may land
the re-date — as its own commit, citing the owner bead, updating the open
`source:waiver-clock-audit` alert. What is forbidden is folding the new date
silently into an unrelated change. That is how an expiry moves with no reviewer
seeing it, and it is how the last two rollovers got "fixed".

## Checked source-level resource ratchets

`test/test-resources.toml` is the checked P0.4 resource ledger. It scans tracked
Go source through parsed syntax and import identity, while only `*_test.go`
files contribute resource occurrences. The raw audit and source-debt rows
freeze process, sleep, environment, CWD, slow-process, HTTP test-server, and
package-level `net` stream/packet listeners, `net.ListenConfig` listeners,
direct `syscall.Listen`, explicit listener-owning helper identities, and typed
or literal tmux dependency call/file totals.
Exact Medium rows name a repository-relative directory, package clause,
top-level runnable owner, and resource list. Small-debt rows apply those exact
owners without weakening the raw anti-growth ratchets.

The Go-owned `bootstrapPolicy` pins every row's ceiling, historical totals,
owner, invariant, resource owner, migration, and expiry. Ordinary source
growth fails against that ceiling, and TOML-only normalization, relabeling, or
metadata edits fail against the policy before the live census is compared.

Changing `bootstrapPolicy` together with the TOML and generated table is an
explicit policy change that requires the same staged-diff council review as
other test-infrastructure changes. The guard makes ordinary drift visible; it
does not claim that self-modifying source can be cryptographically forbidden.

`[[reviewed_hermetic_body]]` rows record a narrower fact than a Small-test
classification: the exact untagged top-level test body and every statically
resolved receiverless helper in the same package contain none of the resource
identities cataloged below. A row is exact, code-owned, and stale-checked; it
cannot use a wildcard, silently move to another test, or claim an effective
Small size while package setup remains Medium. The checked call graph follows
direct helper calls and references used as local function aliases across Go
files in the same package, and terminates safely on cycles.

This is intentionally not a universal hermeticity proof. Cross-package calls,
method and interface dispatch, package-level callback indirection, and
resources absent from the catalog remain manual-review boundaries. In
particular, `TestPrepareWaitWakeState_ResolvesRigDependencyBeads` and
`TestDoSessionWake_PokesManagedControllerAfterStateChange` have reviewed
hermetic bodies but still run as Medium because `cmd/gc` owns a process-mutating
`TestMain`. `TestDoSessionWait_RegistersReadyWaitForRigDependency` has the same
reviewed-hermetic guarantee for the wait-registration use case.
`TestCmdSessionWait_AllowsRigDependencyBeads` remains the singular
CLI/config/file-store split-store composition proof for wait, while
`TestManagedBdRigProviderStoreRecoversAfterHardKillPortRebind` owns the real
managed-provider hard-kill/port-rebind boundary. Likewise,
`TestCmdSessionWake_PokesManagedControllerAndRequestsSuspendedStart` remains the
singular CLI/config/file-store/controller-socket composition proof for wake.
`TestDoMailInbox_RendersMessagesFromReader` owns inbox rendering through the
consumer's one-method reader port, while
`TestCmdMailInbox_NormalizesCanonicalManagedProviderEnvAndReadsInbox` remains
the singular CLI/mail/canonical-`GC_BEADS`/real-Dolt store-factory composition
proof. Full managed-city lifecycle and recovery stay with their focused
provider-store owners instead of being repeated by each command consumer. Body
review is not a reason to remove a retained boundary test.

`TestDockerSessionProtocol` owns fast Docker CLI mapping, injected failures,
and cleanup transitions through a strict `PATH`-injected executable.
`TestDockerSessionScript` (`//test/containerhost`, integration tier) is the
composition owner: it drives `scripts/gc-session-docker` through every
session operation against `test/containerhost`, an emulated container host
that runs each container as a tagged group of host processes with its own
`/run`, an image-defined `PATH` and the adapter's real in-container tmux. It
needs no Docker daemon, privileges or user namespaces, so it runs on every
rbe-west lane, fork lanes included. What it does not prove is Docker itself
(image builds, pulls, cgroups, namespaces).

The canonical identity is package directory plus package clause plus top-level
`Test`, `Benchmark`, `Fuzz`, or `TestMain` name. Nested function literals and
subtests retain that top-level lexical owner. Methods, wrong signatures, and
helper functions are not runnable owners; resources lexically inside helpers
remain Small debt even when a Medium test calls the helper. Likewise, a
`TestMain` row classifies inherited package setup but exempts only matching
calls inside `TestMain`, never sibling tests.

This bootstrap does **not** infer resources recursively through arbitrary
helper calls or claim a complete shared-resource inventory. P0.4c currently
covers the three `net/http/httptest` constructors that open loopback servers
and the exact package-level stream constructors `net.Listen`, `net.ListenTCP`,
and `net.ListenUnix`; packet constructors `net.ListenPacket`, `net.ListenUDP`,
`net.ListenIP`, `net.ListenUnixgram`, and `net.ListenMulticastUDP`;
`net.ListenConfig.Listen` and `ListenPacket` on lexically identified receivers;
and direct `syscall.Listen`. The tmux catalog recognizes canonical `test/tmuxtest`
namespace/lifecycle helpers, imported `internal/runtime/tmux` production
constructors, and literal `os/exec` tmux commands and probes. Its untagged
source census is 6 calls in 2 files, all owned by exact Medium `TestMain`
rows; build-tagged calls remain E1 Large inventory rather than being relabeled
Medium. `NewSocketParentDir`, `HoldAliveSentinel`, and the PID-directory
helpers remain part of the separate shared-host resource tail. Direct
`syscall.Socket`/`Bind` setup calls remain outside this catalog.

The listener-helper catalog is an explicit function-identity proxy, not
recursive call-graph inference. It recognizes same-package calls to the
`cmd/gc` package `main` helpers `runSupervisor`, `startControllerSocket`,
`runController`, `registryBrowserLogin`,
`managedDoltPortAvailableForHost`, and `startNudgeWakeListener`; the
`test/dashport` package `dashport_test` helper `newHarness`; and same-package
or import-identified calls to `internal/runtime/runtimecapability.Run` and
`test/acceptance/helpers.WriteSupervisorConfig`. Same-package identity requires
the exact directory, package clause, receiverless function declaration, and
name; lexical shadows, same-named function values, wrong directories/packages,
and foreign imports do not count. Its untagged source and Small-debt census is
38 calls in 13 files. The 20 tagged calls in 10 files stay in E1 Large
inventory, with no Medium exemption, for 58 calls in 23 files across all
tracked test source.

`net.FileListener`/`FilePacketConn` descriptor duplication, method-backed
`acp.(*Provider).Start` and `subprocess.(*Provider).Start` listeners,
conditional `cliauth.Client.Login` and `supervisor.LoadConfig` listener paths,
Dolt, and other shared-host resources remain explicit follow-up catalogs. A
Medium resource may describe a helper-backed runtime
cost, but only syntax-owned calls in that exact runnable declaration
leave Small-debt accounting. The `ListenConfig` matcher uses lexical Go types
to follow same-file values, pointers, parameters, aliases, and typed factory
results rooted in the imported `net.ListenConfig` type; it does not load
cross-file package bodies or host toolchain export data.
The tmux helper match is an explicit dependency/namespace proxy; it does not
claim a recursive inventory of the helper's environment mutations. Function
aliases and wrappers, variable or absolute command names, `sh -c`, `exec.Cmd`
literals, `Guard` methods, and same-package bare constructors remain deliberate
manual-review boundaries. `ga-cp3hwi` owns the listener, tmux, Dolt, and
shared-host catalogs. E1
separately owns Large journey and provider entries.

The scanner recognizes direct calls to `os/exec.Command{,Context}` and
`time.Sleep`; package-level `net.Listen`, `ListenTCP`, `ListenUnix`,
`ListenPacket`, `ListenUDP`, `ListenIP`, `ListenUnixgram`, and
`ListenMulticastUDP`; `net.ListenConfig.Listen` and `ListenPacket` on identified
receivers; direct `syscall.Listen`;
`net/http/httptest.NewServer`,
`NewTLSServer`, and `NewUnstartedServer`; and `os.Setenv`, `os.Unsetenv`,
`os.Clearenv`, and `os.Chdir`. `Setenv` and `Chdir` on a `testing.T` or
`testing.TB` receiver are deliberately excluded: they restore the prior value
when the test ends, so they are not ambient environment or cwd debt. A receiver
identifier for those two methods that cannot be resolved lexically still fails
closed with a scan error rather than being silently skipped. For tmux it
recognizes `ConfigureProcessEnv`,
`KillAllTestSessions`, `NewGuard`, `NewGuardWithSocket`, and `RequireTmux` from
`test/tmuxtest`; `NewProvider`, `NewProviderWithConfig`,
`NewSeamBackedWithConfig`, `NewTmux`, and `NewTmuxWithConfig` from
`internal/runtime/tmux`; and literal `os/exec.Command("tmux", ...)`,
`CommandContext(ctx, "tmux", ...)`, and `LookPath("tmux")` calls. It also
recognizes the listener-helper identities listed above and the receiverless
`skipSlowCmdGCTest(*testing.T, string)` definition and its same-package calls.
An unresolved cross-file call counts only when that directory and package own
the canonical helper. Import, parameter, and same-file helper matches use
lexical object identity; top-level sibling declarations are indexed by
directory and package so cross-file shadows do not masquerade as resources.
Local shadows and wrong signatures do not count. Parenthesized call
expressions retain the same ownership.

Targeted dot imports of `net`, `os/exec`, `time`, `os`, `syscall`, `testing`,
`net/http/httptest`, `internal/runtime/runtimecapability`,
`internal/runtime/tmux`, `test/acceptance/helpers`, or `test/tmuxtest` are
rejected with file and import context because their resources cannot be
attributed safely; blank imports remain harmless.
Explicit constraints follow Go's leading-header
rules: a pre-package `//go:build` line is effective, while a legacy
`// +build` line must live in a leading `//` comment block separated from the
package clause by a blank line.
Misplaced and directive-like comments do not tag a file. An untagged scope
means the source file has neither an effective explicit constraint nor a
recognized `_GOOS`, `_GOARCH`, or `_GOOS_GOARCH` filename suffix. Implicit
filename constraints use the portion before the first dot, matching Go's
filename semantics. The code-owned platform set mirrors the Go standard
library's [`internal/syslist.KnownOS` and `KnownArch`](https://go.dev/src/internal/syslist/syslist.go):
the past, present, and future values Go owns for filename matching. Scanning
does not invoke the Go tool or network. The `cmd/gc+untagged` scope additionally
requires the source path to be beneath `cmd/gc/`.

Run the focused check with:

```bash
go test -count=1 ./internal/testpolicy/resourcecensus -run '^TestRepositoryLedgerMatchesCensusAndDocumentation$'
```

The historical regex totals remain visible as point-in-time audit evidence.
They can be higher because comments and strings matched, or because the needle
counted testing-receiver helpers such as `t.Setenv` and `t.Chdir` that the AST
census deliberately excludes — which is why the historical environment and cwd
needles now sit far above the live baselines. They can also be lower where the
old needle covered only one spelling and the AST census now recognizes the full
`os` families above. Historical `cmd/gc` needles also included
build-tagged files; the live `cmd/gc+untagged` ratchets do not.
`internal/bdflags/freshness_test.go` is integration-tagged because it invokes
the externally installed `bd` CLI; its process call remains visible in the
all-source audit while staying outside untagged and Small debt.

## Five test categories, clear boundaries

### 1. Unit tests (`*_test.go` next to the code)

Test what the CODE does. Internal behavior, edge cases, precise failure
injection. These are fast and run everywhere.

- Use `fsys.Fake` for consumer logic; use `t.TempDir()` when real filesystem
  semantics own the risk
- Use `require` for preconditions (fail immediately), `assert` for checks
- Construct exact broken states in Go — corrupt files, concurrent writes,
  duplicate IDs, missing directories
- No env vars for controlling behavior — pass dependencies directly
- Same package as the code under test (access to unexported functions)

```go
func TestFileStoreOpenCorruptedJSON(t *testing.T) {
    f := fsys.NewFake()
    f.Files["/city/.gc/beads.json"] = []byte("{not json!!!")

    _, err := beads.OpenFileStore(f, "/city/.gc/beads.json")
    require.Error(t, err)
    assert.ErrorContains(t, err, "opening file store")
}
```

When to use: corrupted data, concurrent writes, specific error types,
double-claim conflicts, rollback behavior, boundary conditions.

`make test` (`bazel test //...`), `make test-go` and `make test-cover`
follow this boundary strictly: they run the fast unit loop only, with
`GC_FAST_UNIT=1` gating slow `cmd/gc` process scenarios. Slow process-backed cases
such as managed Dolt recovery, real `bd` lifecycle, tutorial regression
scripts, and the large `gc-beads-bd` provider suite are routed out of the
default path so local `make check` and the CI unit lane stay focused on quick
feedback. If you need that full `cmd/gc` scenario coverage locally, run
`make test-cmd-gc-process`, or `bazel test --config=integration
//cmd/gc:gc_test`. In CI, the required non-short path is that target in
bazel.yml's gating integration-packages lane, for every PR, fork ones
included. The generic integration package
shards keep `GC_FAST_UNIT=1` for `cmd/gc` unless explicitly overridden,
so they exercise the fast package sweep without duplicating the slow
process-backed suite. If you need the heavier package
coverage sweep locally, use `make test-integration-packages-cover` or
`make test-integration-shards-cover`. As a result, `coverage.txt` is the
fast unit-only baseline; the integration contribution comes from the
shard-specific `coverage.integration-*.txt` profiles and their matching
Codecov flags.

### Cross-category runners, timing, and resource isolation

These are the Go-native runners: for offline work, hosts Bazel does not
serve, and the CI jobs that have not moved to Bazel yet. The gate is still
`bazel test` ("Building and testing" above). When you do run Go-native
sweeps, prefer the repo's sharded wrappers over raw `go test` commands. They use the same buckets as CI, run under a scrubbed environment,
and split single-package bottlenecks such as `cmd/gc` across multiple
processes.

Use these as the default entry points:

```bash
# Fast unit baseline, with cmd/gc split into shards.
make test-fast-parallel

# Full process-backed cmd/gc suite, sharded.
make test-cmd-gc-process-parallel

# Focused product-metrics testhook profile.
make test-productmetrics-testhook

# CI integration buckets, sharded.
make test-integration-shards-parallel

# Fast + process-backed cmd/gc + integration shards.
make test-local-full-parallel
```

By default, the local runners bound concurrency by both detected CPUs and
available memory, budgeting 4 GiB per job and capping automatic fan-out at 16.
If memory cannot be detected, they use three jobs. An explicit override always
wins:

```bash
LOCAL_TEST_JOBS=48 CMD_GC_PROCESS_TOTAL=12 make test-local-full-parallel
```

Both `go test` jobs in `make test-fast-parallel` — the `unit-core` package sweep
and the `cmd/gc` shards — share one 20m per-package budget. A package's wall
time under the fan-out is well above its runtime in isolation, so with Go's
built-in 10m default (which the unit sweep alone used to inherit) contention
panicked six packages with `test timed out after 10m0s` while they were still
working through their test lists. The unit sweep and the shards contend for the
same box, so they share one number rather than drifting onto two. The
integration shards keep `scripts/test-integration-shard`'s own 30m default, and
the `productmetrics-testhook` job scheduled by `full`/`cmd-gc-process` still
inherits Go's 10m. Raise it on a slow or heavily shared host:

```bash
GO_TEST_TIMEOUT=30m make test-fast-parallel
```

For one package, shard top-level Go tests directly:

```bash
GO_TEST_COUNT=1 GO_TEST_TIMEOUT=20m ./scripts/test-go-test-shard ./cmd/gc 1 6
GO_TEST_TAGS=acceptance_b GO_TEST_TIMEOUT=10m ./scripts/test-go-test-shard ./test/acceptance/tier_b 2 3
```

For integration buckets, use the named shard runner:

```bash
./scripts/test-integration-shard packages-cmd-gc-3-of-6
./scripts/test-integration-shard review-formulas-retries-1-of-2
./scripts/test-integration-shard rest-full-4-of-8
```

To force the process-backed `cmd/gc` tests through the package shard for
diagnostics, override the default explicitly:

```bash
GC_FAST_UNIT=0 ./scripts/test-integration-shard packages-cmd-gc-3-of-6
```

Raw `go test` is still appropriate for a focused package or a single failing
test. Do not use it as the default for full local sweeps when a sharded target
exists.

The `productmetrics_testhook` profile has six named owners, including the
real CLI re-exec process contract. In CI it is the Bazel target
`//cmd/gc:gc_productmetrics_testhook_test` (gc_test built with the tag), in
bazel.yml's required unit lane. Its tagged
process owner is intentionally absent from ordinary untagged `cmd/gc` shard
enumeration. The serial `make test-cmd-gc-process` target runs the ordinary
suite and then this profile; `make test-cmd-gc-process-parallel` and
`make test-local-full-parallel` add one independent
`productmetrics-testhook` job beside the ordinary shards.
The existing macOS `mac-cmd-gc-process` matrix runs the same profile once on
shard 6 so the Darwin production composition remains covered without another
Mac runner.

#### Lint and vet (nogo)

Lint and vet run as [nogo](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/blob/master/go/nogo.rst)
inside the Bazel build. `//tools/nogo` bundles `go vet`'s analyzer suite and
the linters `.golangci.yml` enables (errcheck, ineffassign, staticcheck,
unused, errorlint, misspell, gocritic, revive, unconvert, unparam) with
golangci-lint's default settings; `MODULE.bazel` registers it with
`go_sdk.nogo`. Every first-party Go compile is validated, so a finding fails
`bazel build`/`bazel test` wherever it runs, including bazel.yml's unit lane on
rbe-west. There is no changed-scope selection: the action cache re-analyzes
only packages whose inputs changed. `//nolint:<linter>` directives work as with
golangci-lint; staticcheck findings are suppressed by check name
(`//nolint:SA1019`).

| Target | What it runs |
| --- | --- |
| `make lint` (= `make vet`) | `bazel build --keep_going --output_groups=nogo_fix //...`: every package's nogo analysis, no linking. |
| `make lint-changed` | The same for the Bazel packages of changed Go files (`LINT_CHANGED_SCOPE=staged\|tracked\|worktree`); pre-commit uses `staged`. |
| `make lint-golangci`, `make vet-go` | golangci-lint and `go vet` outside Bazel, for the macOS quality job (darwin-only files the Linux nogo build does not compile). |
| `make lint-changed-go` | golangci-lint and `go vet` over the packages of changed Go files, outside Bazel; pre-commit runs it, with a banner, where bazel is not installed. |

The golangci-lint targets run the linter under `go.mod`'s Go
(`LINT_GOTOOLCHAIN` overrides it). The linter type-checks the standard
library from source, and it cannot load the standard library of a Go newer
than the one that built it.

`tools/nogo/config.json` scopes the analyzers the way golangci-lint saw the
tree (no external repos, generated `_gen.go` files, testdata) and carries the
path/text exclusions from `.golangci.yml`; keep the two in step while the
macOS job still runs golangci-lint. `unused` and `unparam` report only from
compile units that include test files, because golangci-lint analyzes a tested
package together with its tests; see `tools/nogo/analyzers/internal/testunit`.

`make test-ci-policy` runs the focused lint-placement and formatting-scope
contracts. A self-binding test in the CI policy package rejects any Makefile
change that removes this focused Go suite from the target.

#### Historical timing summaries

The opt-in timing artifacts produced by `scripts/go-test-observable` can be
aggregated offline across caller-curated successful `main` push runs:

```bash
go run ./scripts/test-timing-summary.go /path/to/downloaded-artifacts \
  >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
```

Use the same strict parser to emit the versioned machine-readable history
snapshot:

```bash
go run ./scripts/test-timing-summary.go --format=json \
  /path/to/downloaded-artifacts > timing-history-v1.json
```

The summarizer recursively reads schema-v1 JSON artifacts, deduplicates
identical downloads, and rejects conflicting artifacts with the same workflow,
run, attempt, job, shard, and variant identity. It emits the ten slowest
top-level tests by observed p95 and the ten highest-variance top-level tests
for each comparable `(job, variant, runner label, OS, architecture, CPU count)`
profile. Ephemeral runner names do not split profiles. Package terminal rows
are shard totals rather than independently scheduled work, and nested subtests
are diagnostic until the shard manifest explicitly promotes them, so neither
is ranked. Statistics use successful durations only while retaining failure
and skip counts. Percentiles use the empirical nearest-rank method, variance
is population variance in seconds squared, and samples are not trimmed.

The JSON snapshot groups units by that same comparable profile and preserves
every successful observation with its exact artifact identity and tested SHA.
Profiles and units have canonical ordering. Observations compare the raw string
tuple `(workflow, run_id, run_attempt, job, shard_id, variant)` lexically, then
tested SHA and duration; run IDs and attempts are opaque strings, so `002`,
`10`, and `2` remain distinct and sort in that order. Identical artifact
downloads increment `duplicate_artifact_count` without duplicating samples.
Units that have only failed or skipped remain present with empty successful
observations and `null` statistics. `p75_authoritative` becomes true at five
successful samples and `p95_authoritative` at twenty. `last_success_sha` is the
SHA of the final successful observation in canonical artifact-identity order;
schema v1 has no trustworthy timestamp, so this field is deterministic but not
a claim about chronological recency.

Timing artifact schema v1 does not record the event, ref, or workflow
conclusion, so the tool
cannot prove protected-branch provenance. The caller must supply artifacts
from successful `main` push runs. The JSON snapshot is workflow-neutral input,
not a protected store or planner decision. An observed p75 with fewer than five
successful samples and p95 with fewer than twenty are diagnostic, not
planner-authoritative. The seven-day artifact retention window is not a
protected historical timing database, and this one-shot builder does not prune
observations. Renamed tests remain separate histories.

The storage-boundary mutation mode persists caller-authenticated cohorts
without merging report snapshots:

```bash
go run ./scripts/test-timing-summary.go \
  --update-history timing-history-db-v1.json \
  --run-envelope trusted-run-v1.json \
  --retain-runs 50 \
  --format=json \
  /path/to/this-run-artifacts > timing-history-v1.json
```

All three mutation flags are required together, and retention has no hidden
default. The versioned run envelope names the repository, event, ref, workflow,
run ID, run attempt, tested SHA, conclusion, and RFC3339 completion time. The
database stores each envelope and artifact once, then stores normalized
pass/fail/skip samples by artifact reference. Replaying identical artifacts is
therefore a byte-for-byte no-op; conflicting copies or envelope metadata fail
before the existing database changes. Retention removes whole oldest cohorts
by parsed completion time and recomputes snapshot statistics and the 5/20
authority thresholds from the retained evidence. Publication uses a synced
temporary sibling and atomic rename.

This command validates envelope shape and checks each timing artifact's
`workflow`, `run_id`, `run_attempt`, and `tested_sha` against it. It does not
authenticate who supplied the envelope, prove that the cohort contains every
expected shard, serialize multiple writers, publish `ci-metrics`, or make the
result planner-authoritative. Those are responsibilities of the later trusted
default-branch workflow. Until that workflow lands, use the database as
deterministic storage-boundary evidence only.

#### Local timing-plan dry runs

The local planner consumes the current runnable inventory, the canonical
schema-v1 timing snapshot above, and planner configuration without changing
the active shard topology:

```bash
go run ./scripts/test-timing-plan.go \
  --inventory runnable-inventory-v1.json \
  --history timing-history-v1.json \
  --config timing-plan-config-v1.json \
  > timing-plan-v1.json
```

Inventory and configuration are independently versioned. The minimal inventory
is `{"schema":1,"units":[{"unit_id":"package:TestName"}]}`. Configuration
schema v1 supplies one exact comparable profile, a shard count, a p95 cap, and
shared conservative fallback estimates for that suite/profile invocation. The
profile key is the complete `(job, variant, runner label, OS, architecture,
CPU count)` tuple; profiles are never merged or selected by a nearest-runner
heuristic. All three inputs reject missing or unsupported schemas, unknown
fields, trailing JSON values, and `null` where a contractual array is required.

The current inventory is the only authority for runnable membership. Every
inventory unit is assigned exactly once, and stale timing rows cannot add work.
An exact profile match contributes history. If the requested profile is absent,
the command still produces a complete static plan and records
`history_profile_status: "profile-missing"`; multiple copies of one comparable
profile are malformed and fail. Snapshot counts, identities, nullable
statistics, observations, and authority flags are validated before planning,
including rows for units no longer in the inventory.

History becomes planner-usable in two stages:

- Before five successful samples, p50, p75, and variance use the configured
  static fallback. At five samples, the empirical values become usable.
- Before twenty successful samples, p95 is
  `max(static_p95, 1.5 * selected_p75)`. At twenty samples, empirical p95
  becomes usable.

Units are sorted deterministically by descending p75, p95, variance, and p50,
then stable unit ID, and placed in the shortest p75 shard that remains within
the aggregate p95 cap. No unit is dropped: an individually oversized unit is
marked `p95-cap-exceeded`, while unavoidable aggregate overflow is marked
`shard-p95-cap-exceeded`. Equivalent shuffled inputs therefore emit identical
canonical JSON.

The output is explicitly marked `authority: "dry-run"`. This command reads only
the three named files and writes the plan to stdout. It does not read GitHub
state, authenticate protected provenance, write timing history, publish
`ci-metrics`, perform path gating or hysteresis, decide required lanes, or
activate workflow/shard execution. Those remain deferred to the trusted
control-plane workflow.

In timing artifact schema v1, `commit_sha` is the exact Git revision checked out and tested
(`GITHUB_SHA`). On `pull_request` runs, GitHub sets it to the synthetic merge
commit, not the contributor branch head. Consumers must not interpret it as
source/head identity. A future schema that needs both identities must add
distinct `tested_sha` and `source_sha` fields; schema v1 must not be
reinterpreted.

Tier A command acceptance and external-provider compatibility are separate
gates. `make test-acceptance` uses controlled subprocess and file providers; it
does not require inference or a `bd` executable. `make test-bd-cli-contract`
runs the four version-sensitive `bd` CLI contracts under the dedicated
`acceptance_bd_contract` build tag. CI applies that focused manifest to the
minimum-supported, current, and main-HEAD `bd` versions without repeating the
unrelated Tier A flows.

#### Beads topology tests (`GC_ACCEPTANCE_BD_BIN`, `GC_ACCEPTANCE_LEGACY_GC_BIN`)

Two groups of Tier A tests drive a real `bd` and a real `dolt` instead of the
hermetic providers: the `TestBeadsProxiedDefault*` tests, which prove the
proxied-local default (independent top-level tests, so the sharded Bazel lane
can spread them), and `TestBeadsInitTopologyMatrix`, which walks every
supported way to initialise a beads scope. Both skip typed when their tooling is absent, so the
default `make test-acceptance` run is unaffected.

| variable | selects | who needs it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GC_ACCEPTANCE_BD_BIN` | the `bd` binary under test; must have `--proxied-server`, so bd >= 1.3.0 | both tests, all shapes |
| `GC_ACCEPTANCE_LEGACY_GC_BIN` | a `gc` built before the scope-ownership journal | the matrix's legacy GC-managed shape only |
| `GC_ACCEPTANCE_TOPOLOGY_MATRIX` | opts a run in to the matrix; it is too slow for the Tier A smoke budget and skips without this | `TestBeadsInitTopologyMatrix` only |
| `GC_ACCEPTANCE_PERF` | turns the proxied-native `gc status --json` wall-clock line (0.5s target, gated at 3x) from a log line into an assertion; the nightly `Beads / proxied-native perf lane` job sets it, and `make test-acceptance` passes it through as `ACCEPTANCE_PERF` | `TestBeadsProxiedDefaultNativeLane` only |

`make test-beads-topology-matrix` sets the matrix opt-in and
`GC_REQUIRE_ACCEPTANCE_TOOLING=1` itself, so a missing `bd` or `dolt` fails the
target instead of turning it into a green no-op. Through the general
`make test-acceptance` seam you have to pass `ACCEPTANCE_TOPOLOGY_MATRIX=1`
yourself — `TEST_ENV` is `env -i`, so exporting the variable in your shell is
not enough.

In CI these rows run in Bazel's required acceptance lane
(`bazel test --config=acceptance //test/acceptance:acceptance_test
//test/acceptance:acceptance_solo_tests`). `test/acceptance/BUILD.bazel`
gives `acceptance_test` the pinned `bd` and `dolt` (first on `PATH`, so every
`dolt sql-server` the rows start is a loopback child of the test on the remote
worker), `GC_ACCEPTANCE_TOPOLOGY_MATRIX=1` and
`GC_REQUIRE_ACCEPTANCE_TOOLING=1`. The few rows that wait out minutes of real
Dolt lifecycle (the topology matrix's M1 and M5 shapes, the proxied idle
timeout, the two suspension-quiescence rows) are its `SOLO_TESTS`: each runs
alone in a target of its own, and `acceptance_test` skips them.

The same switch covers a row's own precondition. The lane runs
`TestProxiedNativeLifecycle` and `TestProxiedNativeSafety` under
`GC_REQUIRE_ACCEPTANCE_TOOLING=1`, and a row there whose precondition the
`bd` under test does not produce (a database with no ignored-lane row to
remove, a proxy record `bd` cleaned up after a SIGKILL) calls
`helpers.MissingPrecondition`, which skips locally and fails in the lane.
Those files never call `t.Skip` in a row;
`scripts/acceptance_run_selection_test.go` enforces it.

The legacy shape needs its own binary because no `gc init` on this tree can
produce it: every fresh scope is journaled provider-owned. Build one from a
commit that predates the journal and point the variable at it; without it that
one shape skips and the rest still run.

`dolt` has to be on `PATH`. The matrix runs eight shapes of real Dolt
lifecycle back to back, which takes about an hour, so give it a timeout:

```bash
GC_ACCEPTANCE_BD_BIN=/path/to/bd-1.3.0 \
GC_ACCEPTANCE_LEGACY_GC_BIN=/path/to/gc-pre-journal \
TMPDIR=/data/tmp make test-beads-topology-matrix
```

`make test-beads-topology-matrix` is `make test-acceptance` narrowed to that
test with a 90m timeout. To narrow further — one shape while iterating — use
the same seam directly:

```bash
GC_ACCEPTANCE_BD_BIN=... TMPDIR=/data/tmp make test-acceptance \
  ACCEPTANCE_TIMEOUT=20m \
  ACCEPTANCE_TOPOLOGY_MATRIX=1 \
  ACCEPTANCE_GO_TEST_FLAGS='-count=1 -v -run TestBeadsInitTopologyMatrix/M4'
```

Never point `TMPDIR` at tmpfs: these tests start real Dolt servers, and their
data directories have to survive on a real filesystem.

##### The legacy shapes' one init path

Both legacy fixtures — the matrix's M5 shape and AC-X — initialise through one
helper, `helpers.LegacyInitEnv`, which adds `BD_ALLOW_REMOTE_MIGRATE=1`: bd's
documented scripted/CI consent for its shared-store schema gate.

Without it the old-way `gc init` does not reliably complete. gc's bd pack
pre-creates the city's database and pre-seeds a metadata stub, so its `bd init`
takes the `--force`/`--reinit-local` arm against an existing empty database —
and **that arm bounds its schema migration at five seconds**. A full migration
takes about thirty seconds on a loaded box, so it stops partway and the next
open is refused by bd's own `#5920` gate with "This workspace was NOT created".
The bound is why the same binaries were green on an idle box: the whole
migration used to fit inside it. It reproduces without gc — `bd init --server`
against a fresh database takes ~30s and reaches the current schema,
`bd init --server --force` against an empty one is pinned at ~5.5s and does
not.

#### Resource isolation via gascity-test.slice

On hosts that provision a `gascity-test.slice` systemd user slice (resource
limits for test workloads), the test entrypoints — `scripts/go-test-observable`
(behind `make test` and `make test-cmd-gc-process`), `scripts/test-go-test-shard`,
`scripts/test-integration-shard`, and `scripts/test-local-parallel` — re-exec
themselves inside that slice via
`systemd-run --user --slice=gascity-test.slice --scope --collect --quiet --`.

Enrollment is automatic and strictly best-effort: it only happens when
`systemd-run` exists, the user manager responds, the slice unit is present
(`systemctl --user list-unit-files gascity-test.slice`), and a pre-flight
scope allocation succeeds. Everywhere else (CI runners, macOS, containers)
the entrypoints run unchanged. Nested runners detect existing slice
membership through `/proc/self/cgroup` and never double-wrap. Set
`GC_TEST_NO_SLICE=1` to opt out explicitly. The decision matrix is covered
by `scripts/test-slice-enroll-test` (run by `go test ./scripts`).

Only the wrapped entrypoints listed above are enrolled. Makefile targets
that invoke `go test` directly — `test-acceptance*`, `test-integration`,
`test-integration-huma`, `test-worker-*`, `test-cover`, and similar — run
unconfined even on slice-provisioned hosts.

#### Cross-invocation concurrency bound via push-gate slots

The three resource-control axes are orthogonal: (1) within-run job sizing
(`LOCAL_TEST_JOBS`/`scripts/test-local-job-count`, above), (2) per-invocation
resource isolation (`gascity-test.slice`, above), (3) cross-invocation
concurrency bound — this section. Axes 1 and 2 both operate *within* a
single `test-local-parallel` invocation; neither stops multiple invocations
(a push, a direct `make`, and a CI job, say) from landing on the same host
at once. Two measured incidents (2026-07-14, load 88.07 with 5 concurrent
`test-fast-parallel` runs + 2 gates + 1 `make test`; a later run at load
53.6-82.1 with ~20 concurrent gate processes) showed exactly that: nothing
bounded how many heavy-suite invocations could run concurrently, producing
false-red failures (timeouts, OOM-adjacent slowdowns) indistinguishable
from real regressions.

`scripts/test-local-parallel` — the one place all four heavy targets
(`fast`, `cmd-gc-process`, `integration`, `full`) funnel through — acquires
one of `PUSH_GATE_MAX_CONCURRENT` (default 2) numbered `flock(1)` slots
under `<city_root>/.gc/gate-slots` (or, outside a city, the repository's
common git dir — `<repo>/.git/gate-slots` in a normal clone, and the one
shared common dir for all of a repo's linked worktrees) before running any
jobs, and holds it for the invocation's entire
lifetime. The mechanism (`scripts/push-gate-lock-lib.sh`) is adapted from
`packs/maintainer-pr-review/scripts/run-lock-lib.sh`'s
`mpr_acquire_global_slot` in the gc-management meta-repo, with one
deliberate difference: mpr's caller fails fast, but this gate's caller is
synchronous and human/agent-facing, so on contention it polls with a
bounded wait (`PUSH_GATE_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS`, default 600s; polling every
`PUSH_GATE_POLL_SECONDS`, default 15s), printing an immediate diagnostic
naming current slot holders the moment it starts waiting. Exhausting the
wait maps to `exit 75` (`EX_TEMPFAIL`) — distinct from a real test failure
and from `scripts/push-ownership-guard.sh`'s unrelated `exit 1` contract for
bead-ownership staleness. That 75 is only visible to callers that invoke
`scripts/test-local-parallel` directly: the four Makefile targets and
`.githooks/pre-push` (`make test-fast-parallel` via `.githooks/lib/push-suite.sh`
when bazel is absent or `GC_PREPUSH_SUITE=go`) run it under `make`,
which reports `make: *** [test-fast-parallel] Error 75` and then exits 2.
Through those paths the distinguishing signal is the stderr text, not the
process exit code. The kernel releases the lock automatically when the
holding process exits — success, failure, or crash alike — so a stale slot
can never survive a dead holder; no PID-file liveness probing is involved.
FD inheritance into test jobs is severed at the fan-out boundary, so a slot
that stays locked past its gate means a leaked descendant is still holding
the descriptor (`lsof` on the slot file names it), not a stale file to
delete. The gate needs `flock(1)`, which `docs/getting-started/installation.md`
already lists as required; if it is absent the run proceeds uncapped with a
warning rather than blocking. The run likewise proceeds uncapped, with a
diagnostic, if no descriptor in `[PUSH_GATE_FD_BASE, PUSH_GATE_FD_BASE +
PUSH_GATE_FD_SPAN)` is free — an environment defect is never misreported as
contention. `GC_PUSH_GATE_NO_CAP=1` bypasses the cap entirely for one
invocation.

The slot mechanics are covered by `scripts/test-push-gate-lock.sh`, run
directly as the `push-gate-lock-selftest` job inside `test-local-parallel`
itself (`fast` and `full` modes) rather than through a `go test` trampoline.
A trampoline's `exec.Command` call would itself add a tracked subprocess
occurrence to `internal/testpolicy/resourcecensus`'s baselines — including
the `scope=all` audit row, which fails on any change, growth or shrinkage
alike, with no per-file exemption available — so driving the script as a
plain shell job avoids that ratchet entirely instead of bumping it.

Only `scripts/test-local-parallel` is wired to this gate — the same targets
axis 2 leaves unconfined (`test-acceptance*`, `test-integration`,
`test-integration-huma`, `test-worker-*`, `test-cover`, and similar direct
`go test` invocations) are outside this bound too.

This mechanism does not extend `bd` claim-lease heartbeats across the
wait+run phases. An earlier draft of the originating bead (`ga-owh20p`)
assumed an existing bd-heartbeat workaround needed extending for this
purpose; no such mechanism exists in this codebase (`bd heartbeat` leases
are node-local and ephemeral, never committed to Dolt, so extending them
here would be a no-op). The underlying claim-staleness concern this would
have addressed is tracked separately under `ga-aw5356`, not here.

### 2. Testscript (`.txtar` files in `cmd/gc/testdata/`)

Test what the USER sees. Exercise the real CLI entrypoint by re-executing the
package test binary, then assert on stdout/stderr. These are tutorial regression
tests, not production-binary integration tests.

- Uses `github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript`
- Testscript defaults missing backend env vars to local fakes:
  `GC_SESSION=fake`, `GC_BEADS=file`, `GC_DOLT=skip`
- Fakes have at most three modes per dependency:
  - `GC_SESSION=fake` — works, but in-memory
  - `GC_SESSION=fail` — all operations return errors
  - `GC_SESSION=tmux` — use real tmux explicitly
- `!` prefix means command should fail
- `stdout` / `stderr` assert on output
- `-- filename --` blocks create test fixtures

```
env GC_SESSION=fake

exec gc init $WORK/bright-lights
stdout 'City initialized'

exec gc rig add $WORK/tower-of-hanoi
stdout 'Adding rig'

exec gc bd create 'Build a Tower of Hanoi app'
stdout 'status: open'

-- $WORK/tower-of-hanoi/.git/HEAD --
ref: refs/heads/main
```

When to use: CLI output format, command success/failure, user-facing error
messages, and tutorial CLI flows.

**The env var rule:** if you need more than two env vars to set up a failure
scenario, it's a unit test, not a testscript. In testscript, omitting the
session/beads env vars now means "use the fake defaults," not "use real tmux."

### 3. Integration tests (`//go:build integration`)

Test that real pieces fit together. These may need real tmux, a real
filesystem, real agent sessions, or a real server. Integration shards currently
run behind a coarse Go/shared-path gate; broader REST coverage runs on `main`.
Use explicit profile commands for credentialed live providers until their
scheduled matrix is wired.

```go
//go:build integration

func TestRealTmuxSession(t *testing.T) {
    // actually creates and kills tmux sessions
}
```

When to use: proving real-boundary composition and testing lifecycle behavior
that exists only with real processes. Shared conformance proves fake parity.

For the broad suite, run `make test-integration-shards-parallel`. Raw `go test`
is for a focused package or test, for example:

```bash
go test -tags integration -run '^TestHumaBinary$' ./test/integration/
```

**Supervisor binary smoke test** (`test/integration/huma_binary_test.go`):
builds `gc`, boots the supervisor against an isolated `GC_HOME`, waits
for `/health`, fetches `/openapi.json`, and runs `gc cities` as a
subprocess. Proves the whole stack — build tags, Huma registration,
listener bootstrap, socket paths — wires end-to-end through a real
binary. Run with `make test-integration-huma` or
`go test -tags integration -run TestHumaBinary ./test/integration/`.

**Supervisor API contract tests** (`test/integration/gc_live_contract_test.go`
and focused cases in `test/integration/huma_binary_test.go`): build the real
`gc` binary, start `gc supervisor run` against an isolated `GC_HOME` and
runtime dir, then exercise the HTTP API as a client would. These tests are
not handler unit tests and are not CLI tutorial tests; they prove that the
published API contract survives the full control plane: Huma registration,
OpenAPI generation, supervisor routing, city lifecycle, event publication,
storage providers, and asynchronous request completion.

The live API contract test has a few load-bearing rules:

- Validate responses against the supervisor's live `/openapi.json`. If the
  server says a route returns a schema, the integration test should prove the
  real response matches that schema.
- Exercise API mutations through HTTP only. Set `X-GC-Request` for mutating
  calls and observe durable results through API reads or events, not by
  reaching into internal Go state.
- Treat asynchronous operations as two-step contracts: the HTTP call returns
  quickly with `202 Accepted` and a `request_id`, then a `request.result.*`
  or `request.failed` event appears. Subscribe to `/v0/events/stream` before
  the mutation and wait for the correlated terminal event. If the event-list
  API itself is under test, query it once after that notification.
- Prefer self-provisioned fixtures. The test should create its own city, rig,
  provider/agent/session, beads, mail, formulas, convoys, and order-history
  fixtures where practical, then clean them up through the API.
- Keep the test hermetic. It must not depend on the developer's machine-wide
  supervisor, personal `~/.gc`, default tmux server, or a pre-existing city.
  Use isolated `GC_HOME`, runtime dir, ports, and process cleanup.
- Lock compatibility surfaces explicitly. If generated clients rely on an
  operation ID, method, path template, status code, or response schema, add an
  assertion for that contract rather than relying only on incidental behavior.
- Keep generated-read sweeps read-only. A sweep over OpenAPI GET routes is
  useful for schema and routing drift, but any GET route with unbound identity
  parameters still needs an explicit fixture-backed test.

Use supervisor API contract tests for externally visible behavior that only
exists when the real supervisor process is running: async city/session request
results, event streams, OpenAPI/response agreement, cross-route lifecycle
coherence, and end-to-end provider wiring. Do not put low-level edge cases
here. Corrupt files, exact parser failures, request validation branches, and
single handler error cases belong in unit tests next to the implementation.

#### Dashboard serve-level projection tests (`test/dashport`)

`test/dashport` is the Go serve-level (Layer A) e2e for the dashboard. It stands
up the real supervisor stack — the typed `/v0` API, the host-side `/api` plane,
and the embedded SPA — over a **seeded event log + bead store** via the exported
`api.ServeSeededCity` seam, then drives the exact endpoints each dashboard view
consumes and asserts the projected JSON. It is the layer that catches the
run-view class of regression: a projection break is visible at the Go wire level
here even when every request still returns 200.

The anchor test (`TestAnchorRunProjection`) seeds one run two ways from a single
`testdata/dashport/` corpus — as a store-resident graph.v2 molecule (the
`/workflow/{id}` read) **and** as a `bead.*` event stream in
`<cityPath>/.gc/events.jsonl` (the runproj-backed `/api/city/{c}/runs/summary`
and `/runs/{id}/detail` routes) — and asserts the run is present and non-empty on
both paths. Responses decode into the generated Go wire types
(`internal/api/genclient`) and the `internal/runproj` projection structs, never
`map[string]any`, so a wire-shape drift fails compilation.

Run it in isolation with `make dashboard-e2e-go`
(`go test -tags integration ./test/dashport/...`). It is a Tier 3 integration
package: the CI `packages` integration shard (`go list ./...` under
`scripts/test-integration-shard packages`, invoked by
`make test-integration-shards-parallel`) picks it up automatically alongside the
REST/formula shards — no dedicated shard registration is needed. Its structured
transcript coverage verifies REST-to-SSE cursor handoff, exact replay
suppression, inclusive-tail upserts, and reset parity through the real supervisor
wire.

The opt-in browser layer runs the embedded production SPA in Chromium against
that same `test/dashport` listener. Run it with `make dashboard-e2e-play` after
installing the pinned Playwright browser, or run both layers with `make
dashboard-e2e`. `TestStructuredTranscriptBrowser` asserts the rendered DOM,
request URLs, SSE upsert/reset behavior, duplicate suppression, and a clean
console/network/error-boundary surface. It adds no second HTTP listener and is
not part of the default integration shard because browser binaries are an
explicit local/CI provisioning choice.

#### Dashboard Playwright render smoke (`internal/api/dashboardspa/web/frontend/e2e`)

Layer B is a Chromium render smoke over the **same** `testdata/dashport/` corpus,
loaded through the same importable loader (`test/dashport/corpus`) that Layer A
uses — one fixture source of truth. A small `//go:build integration` binary,
`test/dashport/cmd/fakesupervisor`, serves the seeded stack via
`api.ServeSeededCity` on a loopback listener; the Playwright `webServer` launches
it and points `baseURL` at it, so the SPA and its same-origin `/v0` + `/api`
surfaces are hosted by one handler (no CORS or base-URL override). Each spec
drives a route (Home, Runs, the seeded run detail — the regression view —,
Agents, Beads, Mail, Activity, Health) and asserts three things: the seeded
content renders, **no** React error boundary
(`components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) is shown, and **no** client-error POST
(`/api/client-errors`) fires. It removes all vitest mocks — the built bundle runs
in a real browser against a real HTTP supervisor, so it exercises the full
fetch → generated client → projection helper → render path.

It is a **Tier 3** browser tier — it needs a built SPA bundle + Chromium, so it
is NOT in the Go integration shard set. In CI it is the Bazel target
`//internal/api/dashboardspa/web/frontend:playwright_test`, which `bazel test
//...` runs remotely like any other test: the fakesupervisor builds with the
`integration` tag (`gotags`) and embeds the Bazel-built SPA bundle, Chromium is
Playwright's pinned `chrome-headless-shell` build, and the shared libraries it
needs beyond the worker host are pinned Ubuntu packages (`MODULE.bazel`). The
HTML report and traces land in the test's undeclared outputs. Locally, run it
with that `bazel test` target, or with `make dashboard-e2e-play` through npm
(builds the SPA, builds the fakesupervisor with `-tags integration`, installs
Chromium via `npx playwright install chromium`, then runs the specs);
`make dashboard-e2e` runs both layers. Add new
routes/assertions by editing `e2e/render-smoke.spec.ts`; keep
`e2e/fixtures/expected.ts` aligned **manually** with the exported constants in
`test/dashport/corpus/corpus.go` (there is no automated parity check — the two
are kept in sync by convention).

The current CI Playwright configuration retries once. That is legacy,
noncompliant debt under `ga-80po0c`; do not copy it or treat a retry-pass as
first-attempt reliability.

#### Live worker inference tests (`//go:build acceptance_c`)

`test/acceptance/worker_inference` runs live Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini,
Kimi, OpenCode, Mimo Code, Pi, and Antigravity CLI sessions through tmux and
requires local or CI-provided provider auth. It is not part of PR CI. Run it
deliberately when validating provider behavior:

```bash
make setup-worker-inference PROFILE=claude/tmux-cli
make test-worker-inference PROFILE=claude/tmux-cli
```

Supported profiles are `claude/tmux-cli`, `codex/tmux-cli`,
`cursor/tmux-cli`, `gemini/tmux-cli`, `kimi/tmux-cli`,
`opencode/tmux-cli`, `mimocode/tmux-cli`, `pi/tmux-cli`, and
`antigravity/tmux-cli`. Cursor requires a preinstalled `cursor-agent` binary;
stage auth with `GC_WORKER_INFERENCE_CURSOR_API_KEY`,
`GC_WORKER_INFERENCE_CURSOR_API_KEY_FILE`, or `CURSOR_API_KEY`. OpenCode live
tests use Gemini via `--model google/gemini-2.5-flash` by default; set
`GC_WORKER_INFERENCE_OPENCODE_MODEL` to override it and provide
`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for auth.
The full profile matrix is not wired into nightly CI today. Nightly runs a
separate focused Ollama Tier C subset; use the commands above for these live
profiles until scheduled coverage is added.

### 4. Documentation sync tests (`test/docsync`)

These tests keep the public docs surface honest.

They currently verify:

- tutorial command coverage against the corresponding txtar tests
- local Markdown link targets across the repo docs
- Mintlify navigation page references in `docs/docs.json`

Run them with `make check-docs`, which is:

```
bazel test //test/docsync:docsync_test
```

(`go test ./test/docsync` works for a quick local iteration.)

### Additional integration guidance

**Low-level** (`internal/runtime/tmux/tmux_test.go`): test raw tmux
operations (NewSession, HasSession, KillSession) directly against the
tmux library. Session names use the `gt-test-` prefix.

**End-to-end** (`test/integration/`): build the real `gc` binary and
run it against real tmux. Validates the tutorial experience: `gc init`,
`gc start`, `gc stop`, bead CRUD.

**BdStore conformance** (`test/integration/bdstore_test.go`): runs the
beads conformance suite against `BdStore` backed by a real dolt server.
Proves the full stack: dolt server → bd CLI → BdStore → beads.Store.
Its current caller skips before the suite because of the pinned `bd` version,
so it is a known gap, not a passing production-constructor proof. A local
capability skip is only convenience; required coverage needs an equipped lane
or an explicit expiring waiver.

#### Session safety for end-to-end tests

Test cities use a **`gctest-<8hex>` naming prefix** so sessions are
visually distinct from real gascity sessions (`gc-<cityname>-<agent>`).

Three layers prevent orphan sessions:

1. **Pre-sweep** (TestMain): `KillAllTestSessions()` kills all
   `gc-gctest-*` sessions from prior crashed runs.
2. **Per-test** (`t.Cleanup`): the `tmuxtest.Guard` kills sessions
   matching its specific city prefix.
3. **Post-sweep** (TestMain defer): final sweep after all tests.

#### The `tmuxtest.Guard` pattern

```go
guard := tmuxtest.NewGuard(t) // generates "gctest-a1b2c3d4", registers cleanup
cityDir := setupRunningCity(t, guard)

session := guard.SessionName("mayor") // "gc-gctest-a1b2c3d4-mayor"
if !guard.HasSession(session) { ... }
```

- `test/tmuxtest/guard.go` — reusable session guard helper
- `RequireTmux(t)` — skips test if tmux not installed
- `KillAllTestSessions(t)` — package-level sweep for TestMain

### 5. Coordination tests (`cmd/gc/lifecycle_coordination_test.go`)

Test that components are **called in the right order**. Conformance tests
verify each component's contract in isolation; coordination tests verify
the wiring between components.

**What coordination tests prove:**
- Lifecycle ordering (ensure-ready before init, shutdown after agents stop)
- Hook survival (hooks reinstalled after init wipes them)
- Qualification consistency (all effective methods use the same name form)

**What they don't prove:**
- Component correctness — that's what conformance tests cover
- Full E2E behavior — that's integration tests

**The `exec:<spy>` pattern:**

```go
t.Setenv("GC_BEADS", "exec:"+spyScript)
```

The spy script logs every operation (`ensure-ready`, `init <dir> <prefix>`,
`shutdown`) to a file. Tests read the log and assert on ordering and
arguments. This exercises the real lifecycle code paths in
`beads_provider_lifecycle.go` without needing Dolt.

```go
// Verify ensure-ready precedes init.
ops := readOpLog(t, logFile)
if !strings.HasPrefix(ops[0], "ensure-ready") {
    t.Fatalf("first op should be ensure-ready, got: %s", ops[0])
}
```

**When to write a coordination test vs conformance test:**

| Question | Test type |
|---|---|
| Does `Store.Get` return `ErrNotFound` for a missing ID? | Conformance |
| Does `gc start` call ensure-ready before init? | Coordination |
| Does the mail provider deliver to the right inbox? | Conformance |
| Do all three Effective* methods use the qualified name? | Coordination |
| Does the session provider start a session correctly? | Conformance |
| Does `gc stop` shut down beads after agents? | Coordination |

**The overtesting line:** don't re-verify contracts that an executable
constructor-bound conformance proof already covers. Coordination tests check
call ordering and argument plumbing, not that individual operations produce
correct results.

### Conformance testing

Provider interfaces may expose shared conformance suites in
`*test/conformance.go` packages. Suite availability does not prove exact
production-path coverage. Each behaviorally distinct implementation or
composition must execute the suite without a pre-run skip; thin aliases may use
a focused exact-constructor wiring proof. The table names current callers, not
proof status. The runtime ledger below is the only mechanically checked
constructor-specific inventory today.

| Interface | Conformance suite | Current suite callers |
|---|---|---|
| `beads.Store` | `internal/beads/beadstest/conformance.go` | MemStore, FileStore, exec-backed stores; BdStore caller currently skips; NativeDolt caller uses a test-only storage fixture |
| `runtime.Provider` | `internal/runtime/runtimetest/conformance.go` | See the checked runtime ledger below |
| `mail.Provider` | `internal/mail/mailtest/conformance.go` | beadmail, exec, Fake |
| `events.Provider` | `internal/events/eventstest/conformance.go` | FileRecorder, exec, Fake |
| `fsys.FS` | `internal/fsys/fsystest/conformance.go` | OSFS, Fake |

The `fsys.FS` suite currently proves the portable namespace core: parent and
file/directory collisions, regular-file copying and modes, `ReadDir` errors,
file and directory-tree rename, empty/non-empty removal, and chmod. Symlink
resolution/replacement, atomic-write composition, and operation-scoped fault
and recording decorators remain follow-up contract slices; do not delete their
OS-backed coverage based on the namespace suite alone.

Builtin runtime production compositions are source-bound to `cmd/gc`'s
registry, their constructor-specific contract dispositions, and the table
below. The auto composition lives outside that registry and is bound to the
exact production function and `runtime/auto.New` result it returns. A waiver is
a visible contract gap, not evidence that conformance passes.

A proved row names one runnable test whose final top-level statement invokes
the declared shared contract with an inline factory. The source guard requires
that factory to return the row's exact constructor directly, rejects pre-run
helper gates and direct skip syntax, and permits only named testing operations
plus explicitly ledgered setup functions. E1 separately proves that
build-tagged rows execute in their required CI lane; a source-bound proof does
not claim cadence ownership by itself.

Reusable-double discovery is intentionally bounded, not repository-wide. The
designated boundary is `internal/runtime/fake.go` for the `runtime.Provider`
port. The guard type-checks its declared runtime type context, discovers every
exported concrete type in that file whose value or pointer implements
`runtime.Provider`, and scans the package's buildable non-test files for each
exported receiverless function whose first result itself implements
`runtime.Provider` and resolves to that exact type, either as the value or its
pointer. Constructors may return additional results such as `error`; function
bodies are outside the source guard. A value-returning constructor counts only
when the value method set implements the port. The current surface is
`runtime.Fake` through `runtime.NewFake` and `runtime.NewFailFake`. Aliases do
not create a second double type and collapse to their tracked concrete type; an
exported provider alias that exposes an otherwise-untracked type fails closed.
Caller-local types, methods, unexported helpers, and provider types declared in
other files are outside this boundary. An exported generic concrete type in the
boundary fails closed because an uninstantiated generic has no single provider
method set to inventory.

Other reusable-support boundaries remain explicit follow-up work:
`beadstest.RecordingStore`, the events and mail fakes, `fsys.Fake`, and
`clock.Fake` are not claimed by this table.

The hybrid row deliberately chooses `cmd/gc.newHybridProvider` as its
construction boundary because that is the wrapper returned directly by the
runtime registry. This ledger does not recursively claim the wrapper's internal
tmux, K8s, or hybrid constructors.

`runtime.NewFake`, `auto.New`, `exec.NewSeamBacked`,
`subprocess.NewSeamBackedWithDir`, and `acp.NewSeamBackedWithDir` are
source-bound to the shared runtime contract below. The auto proof runs the
exact production composition once with two fresh in-memory fakes and owns no
subprocess or listener; focused auto tests retain base-versus-ACP routing and
optional-capability coverage instead of duplicating the full suite for each
route. The seam-backed proofs are the only full exec, subprocess, and ACP
runtime contracts: duplicate raw contracts are avoided, and parent-owned
fixtures are reused while each contract case receives a fresh production
wrapper. `TestSeamBackedCapabilitiesParity` separately guards exec's
handshake-derived stream and TTY flags because the shared contract does not
assert optional capability fidelity. Focused raw provider and seam tests remain
for these packages, including legacy overlap that later consolidation may
remove case by case. The default subprocess constructor remains a separate
H5-owned gap because its reachable empty-city-path branch uses shared temporary
state. The default ACP constructor is also an H5-owned gap because it always
uses shared `os.TempDir()/gc-acp-<euid>` state. E1 (`ga-80po0c.6`) owns the Large
provider/E2E manifest and required lane/cadence execution; it does not own
constructor-to-contract source binding.

Rows reading `waived by <bead> through <date>` are governed by "Waiver expiry
clocks" above: the date is enforced through `internal/testpolicy/waiverclock`,
it warns for 14 days on either side, and past that it is fatal in every mode.

Conformance tests verify the behavioral contract (create/read/update/delete,
error handling, concurrency). They deliberately don't test lifecycle ordering
or cross-provider coordination — that's what coordination tests are for.

For the new 0.15 config surface, use
`engdocs/design/packv2/doc-conformance-matrix.md` as the release-gating ledger for
what should block CI now, what should start blocking once warning plumbing
lands, and what remains tracked but non-gating.

### Provider seam inventory

Core provider and lifecycle seams, their dependencies, and coordination test
coverage. This table is a checklist for new provider implementations; the
shared-suite callers and checked runtime ledger above are the conformance
source of truth.

| Seam | Implementations | Lifecycle deps | Coordination tested? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** (`runtime.Provider`) | See checked runtime ledger above | None (stateless start/stop) | Via lifecycle start order test |
| **Beads** (`beads.Store`) | See shared-suite callers above; production selection includes NativeDoltStore and BdStore | ensure-ready → init → hooks | `TestLifecycleCoordination_*` |
| **Mail** (`mail.Provider`) | beadmail, exec, Fake | Depends on beads store | No — not a lifecycle seam; conformance sufficient |
| **Events** (`events.Provider`) | FileRecorder, exec, Fake | None | No — provider conformance covers record, query, and watch behavior |
| **Managed beads lifecycle** (`cmd/gc`) | `ensureBeadsProvider`, `shutdownBeadsProvider` | ensure → init, stop after agents | Covered by beads lifecycle (exec spy) |

**Adding a new provider:** When adding a new implementation of any seam:
1. Run the conformance suite against it (mandatory)
2. If the provider has lifecycle dependencies (startup ordering, shutdown
   sequencing), add a coordination test using the `exec:<spy>` pattern
3. Update this table

## Test deadline rule

Any test timer that races a goroutine, exec, or socket start must be ≥ 10s.
Use `testutil.GoroutineRaceTimeout` or `testutil.ExecRaceTimeout` from
`internal/testutil/timeout.go`.

A sub-second constant for such a timer is a CI reliability defect: the
operation completes in < 1s on an idle machine but fails under CI CPU
saturation. The only exception is a timer that is itself the subject under
test (e.g., testing that a function honours a 100ms deadline).

### Floors, ceilings, and inputs

`GoroutineRaceTimeout` and `ExecRaceTimeout` are **floors** — the minimum a
deadline may be. They are not a target to set every wait to.

Some packages additionally define a **hang budget**: the point at which the
package gives up and declares a wait wedged. `cmd/gc` has one (`hangBudget` in
`cmd/gc/hangbudget_test.go`), derived from `GoroutineRaceTimeout` rather than
declared independently, so there is one source of truth. Which to reach for:

- **Does any assertion depend on how long the wait took?** Keep an explicit
  deadline and comment which bound it asserts. This is the "subject under test"
  exception above.
- **Is the wait purely a hang detector** — the real assertions come after it
  returns? Use the package's hang budget (`awaitClose`/`awaitCond` in `cmd/gc`).
  Sizing it is not a correctness knob: these helpers return the instant their
  condition is met, so raising the budget does not slow a passing run and
  lowering it does not make the suite stricter. It only changes how long a
  genuinely wedged test takes to report.
- **Otherwise**, use `GoroutineRaceTimeout` / `ExecRaceTimeout` directly.

Two things are never migrated to a hang budget:

- **A value the test feeds the system** — a timeout passed *into* the code under
  test defines the scenario being exercised, not how patiently the test watches.
  Widening one makes the test prove less.
- **The window of a negative assertion** ("nothing arrived within X"). There the
  window *is* the assertion; budget-governing it makes the test slower and
  weaker.

## Decision guide

| Question you're testing | Tier |
|---|---|
| Does `gc bd create` print the right output? | Testscript |
| Does `gc start` fail gracefully without tmux? | Testscript (`GC_SESSION=fail`) |
| Does `gc rig add` fail for a missing path? | Testscript (real missing path) |
| Does FileStore reject corrupted JSON? | Unit test |
| Does FileStore roll back after a save failure? | Unit test |
| Does concurrent bead creation avoid corruption? | Unit test |
| Does startup roll back if step 3 of 5 fails? | Unit test |
| Does a real tmux session start and respond to send-keys? | Integration |

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `testing` (stdlib) | `t.TempDir()`, `t.Run()`, subtests, build tags |
| `github.com/stretchr/testify` | `assert` and `require` — cleaner assertions |
| `github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript` | Tutorial regression from `.txtar` files |

## Test doubles

No mock libraries. No `gomock`. No `mockgen`. Reusable test doubles are
hand-written concrete types kept beside the port they implement. Small
consumer-local stubs and function fakes may remain beside their consumer when
they are not reusable provider implementations.

### Reusable fast substitutes

| Double | Interface | Package | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runtime.Fake` | `runtime.Provider` | `internal/runtime` | In-memory state + spy + broken mode |
| `fsys.Fake` | `fsys.FS` | `internal/fsys` | In-memory maps + spy + per-path error injection |
| `beads.MemStore` | `beads.Store` | `internal/beads` | Real logic, in-memory backing (also used by `FileStore` internally) |
| `mail.Fake` | `mail.Provider` | `internal/mail` | In-memory message state + broken mode |
| `events.Fake` | `events.Provider` | `internal/events` | In-memory event log + event-driven watchers + read/watch failure mode |

### Spy pattern

Some fakes also record calls as `[]Call` structs. Verify interactions only when
the arguments or ordering are the behavior under test; otherwise assert the
resulting state. Use a synchronized snapshot accessor when calls may still be
concurrent:

```go
sp := runtime.NewFake()
_ = sp.Start(context.Background(), "worker-a", runtime.Config{})
_ = sp.Attach("worker-a")

// Verify call sequence recorded by the fake runtime.
want := []string{"Start", "Attach"}
for i, c := range sp.SnapshotCalls() {
    if c.Method != want[i] { ... }
}
```

### Error injection strategies

Use the narrowest pattern that expresses the failure boundary:

**Per-path errors** (`fsys.Fake`) — fine-grained, fail specific operations:
```go
f := fsys.NewFake()
f.Errors["/city/rigs"] = fmt.Errorf("disk full")
```

**Modal errors** (`runtime.Fake`, `mail.Fake`) — whole-provider
unavailability. `events.NewFailFake()` fails reads and watches but still records
events because `Recorder.Record` cannot return an error:
```go
f := runtime.NewFailFake()
```

### Compile-time interface checks

An explicit compile-time assertion is useful for a provider or adapter:

```go
var _ Provider = (*Fake)(nil)
```

The conformance factory also proves interface assignability. Neither form
proves behavioral parity by itself; the shared conformance suite does.

### Fakes live next to the interface

Reusable provider fakes are exported types in the same package as their
interface. This makes them importable by cross-package unit tests (for example,
`cmd/gc` imports `runtime.NewFake()`). One-off stubs stay local to avoid growing
a global support API.

## The do*() function pattern

Many CLI commands use this split when command wiring and testable behavior need
separate owners:

- **`cmdFoo()`** — wires up real dependencies (reads cwd, loads config,
  calls `newSessionProvider()`), then calls `doFoo()`.
- **`doFoo()`** — pure logic. Accepts all dependencies as arguments.
  Returns an exit code.

Unit tests call `doFoo()` directly with fakes:
```go
mp := mail.NewFake()
_, _ = mp.Send("alice", "worker-a", "Build complete", "Ready for review")
code := doMailInbox(mp, "worker-a", &stdout, &stderr)
```

Testscript tests call `gc foo` through the real command construction path. Do
not introduce a `do*()` wrapper mechanically when a smaller injected function
or existing domain API is the clearer seam.

### When to use each

| I want to test... | Call |
|---|---|
| Pure logic with injected failures | `doFoo()` with a fake |
| CLI output format, exit codes | `exec gc foo` in txtar |
| That the factory wiring is correct | `exec gc foo` in txtar with `GC_SESSION=fake` |

## The executor interface pattern

When a function's **argument construction** is the behavior under test
(flag injection, command building), extract the subprocess call behind
an executor interface. This separates "what arguments are built" from
"running a real binary."

**When to use:** Code that constructs `exec.Command` arguments
conditionally (socket flags, env vars, flag lists). The test verifies
the args array, not the subprocess outcome.

**When NOT to use:** When the logic under test is the orchestration
sequence (which methods are called in what order). Use a narrow coordination
port or recording collaborator instead.

**Example:** `tmux.executor` — `fakeExecutor` captures the `[]string`
args passed to each tmux command. Tests verify socket flags, UTF-8
flags, and argument ordering without a tmux binary.

## Env var fakes for testscript

Testscript needs fakes too, but can't inject Go objects. The CLI has
factory functions that check env vars and return the appropriate
implementation.

**Current env vars:**

| Env var | Values | Factory | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GC_SESSION` | `fake`, `fail`, (absent) | `newSessionProvider()` in `cmd/gc/providers.go` | `cmd_start.go`, `cmd_stop.go`, `cmd_agent.go` |
| `GC_BEADS` | `file`, `bd`, (absent) | `beadsProvider()` in `cmd/gc/providers.go` | bead commands, `cmd_init.go`, `cmd_start.go` |
| `GC_DOLT` | `skip`, (absent) | N/A (checked inline) | dolt lifecycle in `cmd_init.go`, `cmd_start.go`, `cmd_stop.go` |

**Design rules for env var fakes:**
- The fake never reads env vars itself — the factory function does
- At most three modes per dependency: works, fails, real
- If you need more than two env vars to set up a test scenario, it
  belongs in a unit test, not testscript

## MemStore: real implementation, not a fake

`beads.MemStore` is not a test-only fake — it's a real `Store`
implementation backed by a slice. `FileStore` composes `MemStore`
internally for its in-memory state and adds persistence on top. This
makes `MemStore` usable both as a production building block and as a
test double for code that needs a `Store` without disk I/O.
