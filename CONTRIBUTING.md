# Contributing to Gas City

Gas City is experimental software, but the repo is now structured for external
contributors. Before making changes, read:

- [docs/index.mdx](docs/index.mdx)
- [engdocs/contributors/index.md](engdocs/contributors/index.md)
- [engdocs/contributors/codebase-map.md](engdocs/contributors/codebase-map.md)
- [engdocs/architecture/index.md](engdocs/architecture/index.md)
- [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what is planned and how to propose work

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Install prerequisites from
   [docs/getting-started/installation.md](docs/getting-started/installation.md),
   plus [Bazelisk](engdocs/bazel-quickstart.md#1-install-bazel): Bazel is how
   Gas City is built and tested, and CI gates on `bazel test`.
4. Set up tooling and hooks: `make setup`
5. Opt in to the project's anonymous, read-only build cache: add
   `build --config=fork-cache` to your gitignored `.bazelrc.local` (or pass
   `--config=fork-cache` per command). Results CI already computed become
   cache hits; misses run on your machine; nothing you build is uploaded.
   Maintainers with an rbe-west client certificate use
   `--config=remote-exec` instead, which executes on the build farm. See
   [engdocs/bazel-quickstart.md](engdocs/bazel-quickstart.md).
6. Run the quality gates: `make check` (`bazel test //...` plus the shell
   guards: unit tests, nogo lint and vet, formatting, generated artifacts,
   docs sync and the policy checks, the same targets CI's unit lane runs).

### Building and testing

CI runs Bazel, so a change is ready when the Bazel tiers it touches pass:

| What changed | Run |
|---|---|
| Anything | `make check` (= `bazel test //...` plus shell guards) |
| Acceptance behavior (`gc` commands end to end) | `make test-acceptance` (= `bazel test --config=acceptance //test/acceptance:acceptance_test`) |
| Runtime, controller, or workflow behavior | `make test-integration` (= `bazel test --config=integration //test:integration_packages //test/integration:integration_test`) |
| Docs, navigation, or links | `make check-docs` (= `bazel test //test/docsync:docsync_test`) |
| Imports, packages, or files added/removed | `make bazel-sync`, then commit the regenerated BUILD files |

Narrow while iterating: `bazel test //internal/config:config_test`.
`go test ./internal/config -run TestX` is fine as a quick inner loop, but it
is not what CI enforces: it runs none of the nogo, format, generated-artifact
or policy targets. Each `make` target above has a plain-Go twin
(`make test-go`, `make check-go`, `make test-acceptance-go`,
`make test-integration-go`, `make check-docs-go`) for offline work. TESTING.md
"Building and testing" has the full tier table.

`make setup` installs a pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` that
auto-formats staged Go files and, when any Go file is staged,
regenerates `internal/api/openapi.json` and `docs/reference/schema/openapi.json`
from the live supervisor. The hook stages both spec copies so the
committed spec never drifts from what the server actually serves. It also
runs nogo (lint and vet) over the staged Go packages
(`make lint-changed LINT_CHANGED_SCOPE=staged`) and `make check-docs` for
Markdown/docs/spec changes. The pre-push hook runs `bazel test //...` when a
push changes Go sources; if it has to fall back to plain `go test` (no
Bazel installed, or no Go at `/usr/local/go` for the cache mode) it says so
loudly, because that suite is not what CI enforces.

**Dashboard SPA.** The dashboard at `internal/api/dashboardspa/web/` is a
TypeScript SPA that talks directly to the supervisor's OpenAPI-typed
endpoints. When `internal/api/openapi.json` changes, the hook regenerates
`internal/api/dashboardspa/web/shared/src/generated/gc-supervisor-client/`
(the typed API client) and, when that or the SPA source changes, rebuilds
`internal/api/dashboardspa/dist/` (the compiled bundle that the Go static
server embeds via `go:embed`). The hook needs Node / npm on your PATH; if
npm is missing and a spec change is staged, the hook now fails closed with
the recovery command, since a stale client would otherwise ship silently
until CI catches it — for unrelated (docs/Go-only) changes it still just
warns and skips the rebuild. The hook runs dashboard typecheck, Vitest, and
production build for dashboard/API-schema changes. Bazel builds and tests
the SPA hermetically (rules_js: a pinned Node.js, and every npm package from
`pnpm-lock.yaml`), and that is what CI gates on. Run `make dashboard-dev`
to iterate with Vite HMR, `make dashboard-build` to produce a fresh
bundle, `make dashboard-check` for typecheck + Vitest + build + the drift
checks (the committed `dist/`, the generated client and `pnpm-lock.yaml`
must match their sources; `make dashboard-generate-client` and
`make dashboard-lock` regenerate the latter two). After changing npm
dependencies with npm, run `make dashboard-lock`. For dashboard or API-schema
changes, also smoke the built app with
`npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port>` from
`internal/api/dashboardspa/web/` and load the served page before pushing.

## Development Workflow

GitHub Issues is the public tracker. Use an issue when it adds context
reviewers need: a user-visible bug, a behavior or design change worth
discussing first, or work that spans several pull requests. The issue holds
why the change is needed, what it affects, and how we will know it works, and
it does not need maintainer approval before you open the pull request. Small,
self-explanatory changes (typos, flaky tests, refactors, CI or docs tweaks)
can go straight to a pull request whose description explains the why.

1. If the change warrants an issue, find or file one. The issue forms ask for
   the motivation, impact, risk, and verification plan (or, for a bug, the
   reproduction and impact), which is most of what review needs. Changes that
   add SDK surface should explain how they pass the
   [Primitive Test](engdocs/contributors/primitive-test.md).
2. Create a branch from `main` (see [Branch Naming](#branch-naming)) and make
   the change.
3. Run `make check`, plus the tiers your change touches from
   [Building and testing](#building-and-testing).
4. Open a pull request that explains the change, shows evidence that it works
   end to end, and says `Closes #<issue>` when there is one.

Using an AI agent is fine; you are accountable for what it produces. Agents
working in this repo read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which carries the same
rules.

What is planned next is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Git hook ownership

**`.githooks` is the single owner of `core.hooksPath`.** Install it with
`make setup`; verify it with `make check-hooks`.

Only one directory can own `core.hooksPath`, and beads' installer claims it
for `.beads/hooks`. Those hooks exec `bd hooks run <hook>` without chaining
onward, so while beads owns the path every gate in `.githooks` — staged-Go
formatting, `lint-changed` (nogo), the three codegen+stage steps, and the
push-time Bazel suite — is skipped on every commit. Nothing reports this: git simply
stops invoking the hooks, so commits look clean while spec-derived drift lands
on the mainline until a later suite failure surfaces the drift.

Reclaiming the path does not disable beads. Each `.githooks` hook forwards to
`.githooks/lib/beads-chain.sh`, which runs `bd hooks run <hook>` with the same
timeout and exit-code carve-outs beads' own integration block used. Adding a
hook that beads manages means adding its `.githooks` counterpart too —
`TestGitHooksCoverEveryBeadsManagedHook` in `scripts/` fails otherwise.

Beads' installer can reclaim `core.hooksPath` at any time. When it does,
`make check-hooks` fails and `make setup` puts it back.

The Bazel drift tests (`//cmd/genspec:genspec_in_sync_test`,
`//internal/api/genclient:genclient_test`, `//cmd/genschema:genschema_in_sync_test`)
are the CI backstop for spec/client drift, but they only see work that
reaches a PR — locally merged branches depend on the pre-commit gate actually
running.

### Branch Naming

Never open a PR from your fork's `main` branch. Use a dedicated branch per PR:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/session-startup upstream/main
git checkout -b docs/mintlify-nav upstream/main
```

Suggested prefixes:

- `fix/*`
- `feat/*`
- `refactor/*`
- `docs/*`

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions.
- Keep functions focused and small.
- Add tests for behavior changes.
- Add comments only when the logic is not self-evident.

## Design Philosophy

Gas City follows two project-level principles that should shape changes:

### Zero Framework Cognition

Go handles transport, not reasoning. If the behavior belongs in the model or
prompt, do not encode it as framework intelligence in Go.

### Bitter Lesson Alignment

Prefer durable infrastructure, observability, and composition over brittle
heuristics that a stronger model should eventually handle better.

For the capability boundary, use the
[Primitive Test](engdocs/contributors/primitive-test.md).

## Docs Workflow

The docs tree is now Mintlify-based.

- Config lives in `docs/docs.json`
- Preview locally with `cd docs && ./mint.sh dev`
- Run docs checks with `make check-docs`

When updating docs:

- Architecture docs describe current behavior
- Design docs describe proposed behavior
- Archive docs keep historical notes out of the main onboarding path
- Updating `GastownCity()`'s `Imports` or `DefaultRigImports` map requires
  updating the auto-import table in `engdocs/design/packv2/migration.mdx`

### Docs link conventions

`docs/` is published to **[docs.gascityhall.com](https://docs.gascityhall.com)**
via Mintlify — it is **not** meant to be read directly on GitHub. The published
site serves **route-based, extensionless URLs**, so internal page links must be
written that way:

| Context | Correct | Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/` page link (Mintlify) | `/tutorials/01-beads` | `/tutorials/01-beads.md` |
| `engdocs/` and root `.md` (GitHub-only) | `engdocs/architecture/index.md` | `engdocs/architecture/index` |

**Why this matters — and why you usually do _not_ want to "fix" a docs path:**
a `.md`/`.mdx` suffix on a `docs/` page link breaks Mintlify navigation on the
live site **even though the file exists on disk**. A link that looks "broken" on
GitHub is very often correct for the deployed site, so reformatting `docs/` links
to be GitHub-friendly is the most common way to *silently break the published
docs*.

Two checks enforce this, both failing **only on net-new** breakage your change
introduces (pre-existing issues won't block you):

- `make check-docs` (`test/docsync`) — on-disk check that `docs/` page links are
  extensionless and that `engdocs/`/root links resolve.
- The **Docs render check** CI Action (`.github/workflows/docs-render.yml`) —
  runs Mintlify's own `broken-links` against your branch vs `main`.

If a `docs/` link is **genuinely** broken on the live site, note it in your PR
and a maintainer will fix it Mintlify-side — don't change the on-disk path to
work around GitHub rendering.

## Make Targets

Run `make help` for the full list. The most useful targets are:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | Install local tools and git hooks |
| `make build` | Build `gc` with version metadata |
| `make install` | Install `gc` into `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` |
| `make check` | Fast quality gates: `bazel test //...` (unit, nogo, format, generated artifacts, policy) plus shell guards |
| `make check-docs` | Docs sync tests, `bazel test //test/docsync:docsync_test` (on-disk link checker; does not run `mint broken-links`) |
| `make check-all` | `make check` plus the acceptance and integration Bazel suites |
| `make test` | `bazel test //...`, CI's unit lane |
| `make test-acceptance` | Acceptance Tier A under Bazel (`--config=acceptance`) |
| `make test-integration` | Integration-tagged suites under Bazel (`--config=integration`) |
| `make bazel-sync` | Regenerate BUILD files after adding packages, files, or imports |
| `make test-go`, `make check-go`, ... | Plain-Go twins of the targets above, for offline work; not what CI enforces |
| `make test-integration-huma` | Supervisor binary smoke test (builds `gc`, boots the supervisor, asserts `/openapi.json` + `gc cities` work) |
| `make dashboard-build` | Build the dashboard bundle under Bazel and sync it into the embedded `dist/` (`dashboard-build-npm`: the same through local npm) |
| `make dashboard-dev` | Vite dev server for SPA iteration |
| `make dashboard-check` | The dashboard's Bazel gate: typecheck, Vitest, build, and drift checks for `dist/`, the generated API client and `pnpm-lock.yaml` (`dashboard-ci` is an alias; `dashboard-check-npm` runs the npm steps locally) |
| `make dashboard-generate-client` | Regenerate the typed API client from `internal/api/openapi.json` |
| `make dashboard-lock` | Re-derive `pnpm-lock.yaml` (what Bazel installs) from `package-lock.json` |
| `make cover` | Go-native coverage run (CI's coverage is `bazel coverage //...`) |

> **`make install` writes to the shared `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.** It (and
> `go install ./cmd/gc`) install `gc` there, and `make install` also re-points
> an existing `~/.local/bin/gc` at the result — so when that path is the binary
> a running deployment uses (commonly `~/.local/bin/gc` → `~/go/bin/gc`),
> installing from any checkout silently replaces the live `gc`, and every later
> `gc` exec runs the just-installed build. To redirect when that isn't
> intended, run `make install INSTALL_DIR=<dir>` (the `install` target writes
> `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` and ignores `GOBIN`), or for a plain
> `go install ./cmd/gc` set `GOBIN=<dir>`. `make build` (→ `./bin/gc`) is
> unaffected.

## macOS Local Development

On macOS, `make build` signs `gc` with a stable local codesigning identity
when one is available. Stable signing helps macOS TCC remember local
permission grants, such as App Management and Apple Events, across rebuilds.

The build auto-detects the first valid certificate in your keychain, in this
order: `Apple Development:`, `Developer ID Application:`, then `GasCity Dev`.
Override the selection with `GC_SIGN_IDENTITY=<certificate name>`.
The signing identifier defaults to `com.gascity.gc`; override it with
`GC_SIGN_IDENTIFIER=<identifier>` only when you intentionally want a separate
local TCC identity. After a successful stable or opt-in ad-hoc signing pass,
the script removes the `com.apple.provenance` extended attribute when present
so macOS does not retain stale local-build provenance metadata.

If no stable identity is available, the build leaves Go's linker-produced
macOS signature unchanged. It does not automatically ad-hoc re-sign the
binary, because ad-hoc signing creates a fresh identity and can cause repeated
TCC prompts. If you need the old behavior for a local experiment, opt in with
`GC_ADHOC_SIGN=1`.

Getting a free local certificate does not require paid Apple Developer Program
membership:

- **Apple Development**: Xcode -> Settings -> Accounts -> sign in with an
  Apple ID -> Manage Certificates -> `+` -> Apple Development.
- **Self-signed**: Keychain Access -> Certificate Assistant -> Create a
  Certificate. Use Identity Type **Self Signed Root** and Certificate Type
  **Code Signing**. Name it `GasCity Dev` for auto-detection, or set
  `GC_SIGN_IDENTITY` to its name.

For official distribution, local development signing is not enough; release
artifacts need a Developer ID certificate and notarization.

## macOS Release Verification

Before tagging a release, run the macOS smoke test on a Mac:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-macos.sh                     # latest release, arm64
GC_VERSION=v0.13.4 ./scripts/smoke-macos.sh  # specific version
GC_ARCH=amd64 ./scripts/smoke-macos.sh       # Intel binary
```

The script downloads the release archive, extracts the `gc` binary, and runs it
inside a `sandbox-exec` jail that denies network access and restricts filesystem
writes to a temp directory. Tests: `version`, `help`, `doctor`, `init`.

Run this after changing build/packaging scripts or upgrading the Go toolchain.

## Commit Messages

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  `type(scope): summary`, e.g. `fix(session): keep work beads on close`
- Use present tense
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Explain *why* in the body; reviewers and `git blame` readers see the commit,
  not the PR thread
- Reference the issue (`Closes #123`) in the pull request description when
  there is one

## Issue Triage Labels

Every new issue gets `status/needs-triage`. Maintainers then move it along
this ladder:

| Label | Meaning | Who applies it |
|---|---|---|
| `status/needs-triage` | Inbox — not looked at yet | Automation, on open |
| `status/needs-info` | Waiting on the reporter for details | Maintainers / automation |
| `status/needs-repro` | Cannot be investigated without a reproduction | Maintainers / automation |
| `status/needs-design` | Real need, but the approach must be agreed before code | Maintainers |
| `status/accepted` | Confirmed and on our radar | Maintainers only |
| `status/help-wanted` | Accepted and explicitly open to outside contributors | Maintainers only |

`kind/*` says what the issue is (bug, feature, docs, chore, ...) and
`priority/p0`–`priority/p3` says how urgent it is.

When you file an issue, automation may apply labels that indicate missing
information. Here is what to expect.

### `status/needs-repro`

Applied when the issue cannot be investigated without a minimal reproduction.
Automation will leave a request comment explaining what is needed. Please reply
within 14 days — the 14-day window starts from that comment, not from when
the label was applied.

### `status/needs-info`

Applied when additional details are required. Automation will leave a request
comment explaining what information is needed. Please reply within 14 days of
that comment.

### What happens next

- **You reply or open a PR that addresses the question**: automation removes
  the label and the stale-close path is canceled. You can always respond even
  after the 14 days have passed.
- **14 days pass with no response**: the issue is closed as "not planned"
  with a comment that references the original request. Replying to the closed
  issue reopens the conversation; include the requested details so triage can
  continue.

Both labels are removed automatically when the original reporter comments on
the issue or pushes a synchronizing commit to a linked pull request.

## Pull Request Pipeline Labels

Maintainers run an automated review-and-merge pipeline. These labels are
applied by maintainers and by that automation; contributors should not add or
remove them.

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status/needs-review` | Review requested |
| `status/needs-review-auto` | Review requested with auto approval |
| `status/reviewing` | Automated review is running |
| `status/review-failed` | Review workflow failed before merge-ready |
| `status/merge-ready` | Review passed; ready for the merge queue |
| `status/merge-queued` | Queued for the deterministic merge |
| `status/merge-failed` | Merge queue needs operator attention |
| `status/human-review-required` | Opt-out from auto-merge; waits for a co-maintainer |
| `needs-architectural-review` | Permanent hold pending architectural review; blocks auto-merge |
| `status/needs-bugflow` | Bugflow investigation requested on an issue |
| `needs-mac`, `needs-review-formulas` | Run optional CI lanes on this PR |
