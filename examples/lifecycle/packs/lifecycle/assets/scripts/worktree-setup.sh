# worktree-setup.sh — idempotent git worktree creation for Gas City agents.
#
# Usage: worktree-setup.sh <rig-root> <target-dir> <agent-name> [--sync]
#
# Ensures the target directory is a git worktree of the rig repo. For
# backward compatibility, the older <repo-dir> <agent-name> <city-root>
# signature still works and resolves the target under
# <city-root>/.gc/worktrees/<rig>/<agent-name>.
#
# Called from pre_start in pack configs. Runs before the session is created
# so the agent starts IN the worktree directory.

# parked mid-rebase with a conflicted index. This runs from pre_start,

# conflict markers in tracked files — and core.hooksPath makes one of
# them an executable hook, so its next commit runs a broken hook.
