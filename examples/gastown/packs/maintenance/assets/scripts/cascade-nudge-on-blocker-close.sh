# cascade-nudge-on-blocker-close — notify dependents when a blocker closes.
#
# When a blocker bead closes (linked via `bd dep <dependent> --blocks
# <blocker>`), the owner of each dependent has no event-driven signal that
# work can resume: they poll, get nudged by hand, or miss the unblock.
#
# This order subscribes to bead.closed events. For each closed bead it
# resolves the dependents linked by a `blocks` dependency and nudges the
# assignee of every open or deferred dependent. Idempotent: a given
# (blocker, dependent) pair is nudged at most once. Dedup state lives in
# $GC_PACK_STATE_DIR/cascade-nudge-on-blocker-close-state.json, so it is
# both city- and pack-scoped — multi-city installs never cross-pollinate.
#
# Event contract note: the close transition emits `bead.closed`, not
# `bead.updated` (a closed bead only emits bead.updated on a later
# metadata edit). Subscribing to bead.closed fires once, exactly on the
# transition this order cares about.
#
# Cross-rig blocker chains within a city are supported via a prefix->rig
# lookup so `gc bd dep list` and `gc session nudge` are scoped to the rig that
# owns each bead. The dep lookup routes through `gc bd` (not bare `bd`) so the
# wrapper runs bd in the owning rig's directory; `--rig` is a gc flag, not a
# bd flag. Cross-city cascade is out of scope.
#
# Runs as an exec order (no LLM, no agent, no wisp).
