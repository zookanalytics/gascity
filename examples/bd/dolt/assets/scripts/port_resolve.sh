# port_resolve.sh — shared GC_DOLT_PORT discovery helper.
#
# Sourced by:
#   .gc/system/packs/dolt/assets/scripts/runtime.sh
#   .gc/system/packs/bd/dolt/assets/scripts/runtime.sh
#
# Defines:
#   resolve_dolt_port_or_die  state_file  [provider_state_file]  data_dir  city_path
#
# Preconditions (caller responsibilities):
#   - managed_runtime_port is in scope (from a sourced runtime.sh above this
#     file in the source chain).
#   - GC_CITY_PATH is set; the caller enforces this at file head.
#
# POSIX /bin/sh only. No bash-isms.

# resolve_dolt_port_or_die — print the discovered Dolt port to stdout, or
# exit 78 with a structured stderr error if no port can be resolved.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1  state_file           Absolute path to .gc/runtime/packs/dolt/dolt-state.json
#                            (or the equivalent for the caller's pack layout).
#   $2  provider_state_file  Optional provider fallback state file.
#   $3  data_dir             Absolute path the caller expects the running server
#                            to be serving from.
#   $4  city_path            Absolute path of the city root, used only in the
#                            error message so the operator knows which city failed.
#
# The legacy three-argument form remains supported:
#   resolve_dolt_port_or_die  state_file  data_dir  city_path
#
# Behavior:
#   1. It calls managed_runtime_port "$state_file" "$data_dir" and, on a
#      non-empty result, echoes the port and returns 0.
#   2. Otherwise, if provider_state_file was provided and GC_DOLT_STATE_FILE
#      did not force a specific state file, it tries the provider state.
#   3. Otherwise, if GC_DOLT_PORT is non-empty in the caller's environment,
#      the function echoes that value and returns 0 as an operator seed.
#   4. Otherwise, it writes the §3 error template to stderr and exits 78.
#
# Preconditions (caller must arrange):
#   - managed_runtime_port is in scope (sourced from runtime.sh).
#   - GC_CITY_PATH is set (the helper does NOT default it; callers already
#     enforce ': "${GC_CITY_PATH:?...}"' at file head).
#
# Output contract:
#   - On success: exactly one line on stdout (the port, e.g. "47823").
#                  Nothing on stderr. Exit 0.
#   - On failure: nothing on stdout. Multi-line structured error on stderr
#                  (§3 verbatim). Exit 78 (whole shell exits, not return).
