# fields now measure the Dolt backup remotes under GC_BACKUP_ARTIFACT_DIR

# and what an operator means when they ask whether the bead store is backed up.
# The migration snapshots that `gc dolt rollback` restores live under

# not look". It initialised freshness to "", age to 0 and stale to false, then
# skipped the block that would overwrite them whenever nothing was found, so a
# probe that measured nothing rendered as a confident dolt_stale:false — the
# one reading an operator must never get from a backup check. The flag is

# Check for zombie dolt processes.
# Use pgrep -x to match only processes named "dolt", then verify
# each is actually running sql-server via ps. This avoids false
# positives from processes that merely mention "dolt" in their args
# (e.g., Claude sessions whose prompt text contains "dolt sql-server").
#
# Rig-local Dolt servers (configured via dolt.port in config.yaml)
# are legitimate — exclude any PID listening on a known rig port.
#
# Foreign Dolt servers (managed by OTHER cities on the same host) are
# also legitimate. gc ALWAYS writes a dolt.pid next to a managed dolt
# config, so the sibling dolt.pid — located by parsing `--config <path>`
# from the process command line — is the authoritative ownership signal:
# present and self-referential means a healthy gc-managed instance.
# Externally-managed Dolt servers (launchd- or manually-started servers
# for unrelated apps, on their own datadir and port) also carry an
# explicit `--config` but have NO sibling dolt.pid; they are not town
# strays and must not be flagged, or health patrol automation could kill a
# healthy, unrelated server. Without these exclusions, every patrol in
# every city flags the others (and unrelated apps) as zombies on shared
# dev hosts. The `--config` parse happens inside the single bounded
# `ps -eo` + awk pass below (it already has the full args line in hand);
# only the sibling dolt.pid read is left to the shell loop, which
# iterates O(matched sql-servers) — never O(all pids/zombies) — so the
# bounded-fork invariant still holds.
#
# GC_HEALTH_SKIP_ZOMBIE_SCAN is a test-only escape hatch. Zombie
# enumeration spawns one `ps` per matching process, which on shared
# dev machines with many accumulated dolt processes dominates the
# runtime of the hang-mode test below. Setting it to "1" skips the
# scan so tests exercise just the bounded-probe behavior they care
