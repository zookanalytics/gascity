//
// Two verbs, both of them provider-owned lifecycle operations gc already runs
// elsewhere. The narrowness is the point: bd owns the proxy and its Dolt child,
// so admission's escalation ladder must be expressible as "ask bd to make its
// proxy healthy" and nothing else. An interface with a third method would be an
// invitation to reach for a bd read, and a bd read is the fork this whole lane
// exists to remove.
//
// Neither verb may spawn anything gc owns. Ping is bd's own `ping`, which
// adopts or restarts bd's proxy; Recover is the provider's `recover`. gc never
// execs dolt, and never starts a proxy itself.
type ProviderOps interface {
	// Ping asks bd to make the scope's proxy healthy, and reports whether it
	// could. A failure bd ITSELF reported — the verb ran to completion and

	// gc could not build) must not be. The no-greeting ladder escalates on the

	// generation is the proxy generation admission saw as a zombie. Recover
	// may wait for whatever serializes provider verbs (gc's per-city

	// holds that serialization, Recover must re-read the scope's proxy record
	// and run nothing unless it still names generation; otherwise it returns

// GenerationSet is a process-local set of proxy generations, with a TTL.

// Two of them bound the escalation ladder across the many opens a single gc
// command performs: one records generations a ping has already proven healthy,
// so a later open in the same process does not buy the same answer twice, and
// one records generations a recover has already been spent on, so a proxy that
// stays sick is declared a zombie instead of being recovered in a loop.
//
// It is a set of generation STRINGS rather than of PoolKeys because the
// question is about a proxy process, and one proxy legitimately serves several
// databases — a rig sharing its city's proxy root differs from the city in the
// database alone, and recovering for the rig would otherwise look unrecovered
// to the city.
//
// # Why the entries expire (council A-F5)
//
// They did not, and the set is process-lifetime. On a one-shot command that is
// the same thing; on a controller or an api server it is not, and the
// difference is an operator-visible fault.
//
// A long-running gc pings a scope at boot, which records that generation as one
// a rung has been spent on. Two hours later that generation's Dolt child is
// OOM-killed: the endpoint accepts and never greets, the ladder walks its three
// probes, reaches the ping rung, finds the generation already "spent" — and
// falls straight through to the RECOVER rung. Recover is the provider script's
// `provider_owned_retire_local_dolt` (`bd dolt stop`) plus `bd ping`, and the
// script's own comment says that for a city root this takes down the one proxy
// and Dolt child serving hq and every other rig, under live agents. A plain
// `bd ping` — which the script documents as blocking until the Dolt child
// reports ready — would have fixed it without cycling anything.
//
// The design's memo (3.3 step 2) exists to dedupe the many opens of ONE
// command. generationMemoTTL is that window made explicit: long enough that no
// single command or burst of opens buys the same answer twice, short enough
// that an hours-old ping is not mistaken for a rung this incident has spent.

// The process-local pin memo.

// alone opens 17+ — and admission's cheapest healthy path still costs one
// probe SESSION against bd's proxy. Seventeen sessions per run is seventeen
// accepted TCP connections bd's idle watcher counts, for an answer that cannot
// have changed.
//
// It is keyed on the two files the answer is derived from, not on time alone: a
// proxy.pid or a sidecar that changed invalidates the entry immediately,
// whatever the TTL says. The TTL is the guard interval, so the memo can never
// hold an answer longer than the tick that would have re-checked it.
//
// It is ALSO keyed on the lane — LongLived — and that is council C-F2. Admit
// consults the memo before admitOnce, and the finite-idle refusal (the Q1
// deviation) lives inside admitOnce, after it. With a lane-blind key a one-shot
// open of an operator-initialized finite-idle scope admitted, memoized its pass,
// and a LONG-LIVED open of the same scope inside the TTL got that pass back —
// so gc held a resident native handle across a window in which bd retires the
// proxy and its Dolt child, which is the exact outcome Q1 says PR2 refuses.
// Production takes that path: cmd/gc/main.go's openStoreAtForCity is
// longLived=false and cmd/gc/api_state.go is LongLived=true, in one binary.
//
// Keying on the lane rather than moving the idle rule ahead of the memo is the
// smaller change and the more honest one: "may this scope be served natively"
// is a DIFFERENT question for a handle held for 40ms and one held for the
// process lifetime, and a memo keyed on less than the question is a memo that
// answers a question nobody asked.
//
// # What the stamp CANNOT see, and what bounds it (council A-F3)
//
// A migration writes neither proxy.pid nor the sidecar. The cursors are read
// from the database, so no file fingerprint can invalidate an entry when
// somebody runs `bd migrate` (or a newer bd opens the database) inside the TTL:
// the memo hands back the stale pin, with the stale cursors, and the schema
// gate does not run for that open.
//
// Re-reading the cursors on a memo HIT is not the fix. The cursor read IS the
// probe session, and one probe session is exactly what a memo MISS costs on the
// healthy path — so a memo that re-probed would cost what it saves and delete
// its own reason to exist (17 accepted TCP connections per `gc doctor` run, on
// a proxy whose idle watcher cannot arm while one is open).
//
// Two things bound the exposure instead, and they are stated here so a reader
// does not have to reconstruct them:
//
//  1. proxiedPinMemoTTL caps the entry at proxiedPinMemoMaxTTL however long the
//     operator's guard interval is. GC_BEADS_PROXIED_GUARD_INTERVAL has a floor
//     but no ceiling, so without the cap an operator asking for a quieter tick
//     was also asking the memo to trust a schema answer for that long.
//  2. The guard tick re-reads the cursors every interval and, on drift, now
//     forgets the memo as well as standing the handle down — so the next open
//     in the process re-derives instead of reading an answer a tick has already
//     contradicted. That is a long-lived store's bound only; a one-shot has no
//     guard, and the TTL cap is all it gets.
//
// What does NOT bound it, corrected (council pr2 D-F7). This block used to
// list a third bound: "the library runs CheckForwardDrift at EVERY open, so a
// database that moved ahead of this binary is refused by the library". That is
// true of exactly one lane and one direction, and it was cited as if it covered
// the lane A-F2 exists for. At beads v1.3.0:
//
//   - CheckForwardDrift (store.go:1991) is checkSchemaSkew over CurrentVersion,
//     which is mainSource.currentVersion (schema.go:133-162, :519-521): the
//     MAIN lane, refused only when AHEAD.
//   - A main lane BEHIND is refused by a different check, the shared-store
//     migrate gate (store.go:2939, remote_migrate_gate.go:517-557), which again
//     reads the main lane only.
//   - NOTHING in the library's open consults the IGNORED lane before
//     migrating it. So an ignored lane that moves inside the memo window — a
//     sentinel that vanishes, dropping the library's effective cursor 26 -> 11,
//     is the case that matters — is checked by nobody on a memo hit, and the
//     open replays ignored 0012-0025 against bd's database. Inside the window
//     that hazard is bounded by the TTL cap and the tick above, and by nothing
//     the library does. The post-open observation (ProxiedOpenUnmoved) does
//     not reach it either, and "a memoized pin carries no hash" — the reason
//     this line used to give — understated why (council pr2 E-S4): the replay
//     writes only the dolt_ignore'd plane, which is never committed, so HEAD
//     would not move even if the pin carried one; and the observation's
//     ignored-plane half cannot tell a replay that restored what it found
//     missing from an untouched plane, because the plane has no history and
//     the replay records its cursor with INSERT IGNORE. Carrying the hash
//     into memo hits would close nothing.
//
// One thing the old sentence feared that does NOT happen: bd's documented
// escape hatch BD_IGNORE_SCHEMA_SKEW=1 is read with os.Getenv inside the open,
// but the proxied window withholds the whole BD_ namespace for the duration of
// OpenBestAvailable (openNativeStorageProxied), so an operator's exported hatch
// cannot switch the AHEAD refusal off in-process
// (TestProxiedHermeticOpenScrubsUnlocksAndProjectsAuthorPair pins the unset).
// TestForwardDriftSeesOnlyTheMainLane pins the three library facts above.
