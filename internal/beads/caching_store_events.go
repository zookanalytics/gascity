// ApplyEventSnapshot applies an event whose payload is a complete bead snapshot
// with authoritative dependency coverage, rather than a bd hook patch.
//
// A CachingStore emits exactly such a snapshot after reconciliation absorbs a
// row: notifyChange marshals the whole absorbed bead, dependencies included.
// Bead.Dependencies and Bead.Needs are omitempty, so a bead with no
// dependencies marshals with neither key, leaving that snapshot indistinguishable
// on the wire from a bd on_update payload — which legitimately omits
// dependencies after a removal and must be treated as coverage-unknown.
//
// Guessing wrong in that direction is not a lost optimization, it is a loop: the
// coverage-unknown path drops the dep set, clears the is_blocked verdict
// reconciliation just installed, clears depsComplete store-wide, and stamps a
// mutation sequence that fences the row out of the next pass' absorb. The
// cleared verdict is therefore never repaired, every later pass sees cached nil
// against fresh &false, calls that a change, and emits again — thousands of
// events per minute against a completely idle backing store (ga-yoix1).
//
// Callers that know the payload's provenance use this entry point to say so.
// A snapshot is authoritative for the edges it carries; one with neither key
// keeps the cached edges rather than clearing them, because a row read from a
// backing whose rows omit their edges looks the same on the wire.
