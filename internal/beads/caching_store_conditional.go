// This file holds CachingStore's ConditionalWriter forwarding. The cache
// rule for fenced writes is: forward, and EVICT — never patch, never adopt.
//
// Failure side: the unconditional write paths optimistically patch the cached
// clone when the post-write refresh fails; a conditional-write port of that
// fallback is poison, because the patch cannot synthesize the new revision,
// so every consumer's precondition recovery would re-read the stale revision
// through the cache and re-fail — a livelock indistinguishable from real
// contention. Eviction instead routes the next Get to the backing store
// (dirty-set + entry removal; NEVER a deletedSeq stamp, which would
// short-circuit Get to ErrNotFound without consulting the backing).
//
// Success side: the entry is evicted TOO. The backend does not return the
// committed row or its revision, so a post-write refresh cannot be attributed
// to our write — it may observe a LATER state, and installing anything
// derived from local knowledge over an independently-refreshed revision would
// fabricate a snapshot that never existed at that revision (a later IfMatch
// against it would succeed on fabricated content, defeating optimistic
// concurrency). Until a backend returns the exact committed row, the only
// honest cache action after a fenced write is a miss.
//
// The miss is then filled the way the next Get would fill it, so steady fenced
// writes do not leave the cache dirty and withhold a covering census (see
// CacheRevision). The atomic closer returns the exact committed row, which is
// installed as returned when the evicted row was still the one the write was
// fenced on. The other verbs refetch the row and install it verbatim, never
// overlaid, only when it demonstrably reflects the committed write: the
// written fields match, and either the revision moved off expectedRevision or
// the evicted row was clean at expectedRevision (an idempotent write that the
// backend did not re-stamp). A lagged pre-write read otherwise stays a miss.
// Either install is fenced at the eviction's sequence and keeps that fence
// (seqKeep, like every write path), so a newer local write, event or delete
// wins. Afterwards Get, the dirty-row overlay, reconcile's merge, a Live list,
// Prime's concurrent-mutation path and PrimeActive fence on the write's
// writeSeq as well as its beadSeq, so none of them can install a row read
// before the write. An event with no cached row to merge onto is fenced on
// writeSeq and deletedSeq, and a conflicting event is verified against the
// backing while beadSeq is present or the local write is younger than
// recentWriteVerifyWindow (see CacheRevision for the remaining known limits).
// The refetched row feeds the change notification verbatim.
