// ProxiedStore is the split store of the proxied-native lane: every READ on a
// native library handle over bd's proxy data port, every MUTATION on the bd CLI
// leaf.
//
// # Why a wrapper and not a leaf
//
// The obvious shape — one hand-written read-only leaf — is the shape
// splittest/strict_store.go's package doc warns about, and the concrete loss is
// measurable: CachingStore discovers three of its backing's capabilities through
// PACKAGE-PRIVATE interfaces (listDependencyCompletenessStore,
// cacheDependencySnapshotStore, readyProjectionEnrichmentStore, caching_store.go
// 1440-1450), so a leaf that forgot one would silently turn a complete dependency
// snapshot into N per-bead DepList calls, or drop the is_blocked projection and
// send every readiness read live. A wrapper cannot forget them by accident,
// because the capability set is a compile-time contract right below this comment.
//
// # What the two leaves disagree about
//
// The split is not "the same store twice". Reads and writes land on different
// code with different semantics, and the plan's hazard register enumerates where.
// Each bound is implemented here and named at its call site:
//
//   - H1 wisps: a native MISS on a bead-shaped id falls through to the bd leaf's
//     Get, which has the `bd query --ephemeral` fallback. One fork, only on a
//     miss.
//
//     The MECHANISM this register used to state was wrong, and correcting it
//     matters because PR3 inherits the model (council B-F6). It said "the
//     native Get does not set IncludeEphemeral, so a wisp-tier bead is
//     invisible to it". IncludeEphemeral is not a field of types.IssueFilter at
//     all — it belongs to types.WorkFilter, GetReadyWork's filter, which is why
//     Ready is the only native path that sets it. SearchIssues routes on
//     filter.Ephemeral and filter.SkipWisps, and the native Get
//     (native_dolt_store.go's Get: IDs plus IncludeDependencies) sets NEITHER,
//     so searchInTx takes the nil-Ephemeral branch and MERGES the wisps table.
//     gc never sets SkipWisps anywhere outside a test.
//
//     So H1 is not a regression on this lane: the native Get can see a wisp,
//     and the fallback below is a safe no-op on a hit and matches BdStore's own
//     behavior on a miss. It is kept because it costs nothing when the native
//     read answers, and because "the bd leaf can answer a not-found that the
//     native leaf could not" stays true for reasons other than wisps — a
//     relocated class, a bead the pool's generation cannot see. See Get.
//
//   - H2 one sidecar: localSidecar.ensureLoadedLocked latches loaded=true on
//     first use and never re-reads, so two instances over one file diverge for the
//     process lifetime. The wrapper owns ONE — the bd leaf's — and points the
//     native leaf at the same object at construction. See NewProxiedStore.
//
//   - H3 AtomicTx: the native leaf answers true and the bd leaf is staged and
//     non-atomic. Tx runs on the bd leaf, so AtomicTx follows the bd leaf. See
//     AtomicTx.
//
//   - H4 graph-apply: *NativeDoltStore declares StorageGraphApplyStore and
//     EphemeralGraphApplyStore, and cmd/gc's wrapStoreWithBeadPolicies picks
//     beads.GraphApplyFor(store) at WRAP time — so a claim here would route
//     policy-selected ephemeral graph creates into a native write. The wrapper
//     deliberately implements neither and hands out the bd leaf's applier. See
//     proxied_store_capabilities.go.
//
//   - H5 relocated classes: BdStore.guardRelocatedClassIDs turns an id-scoped
//     read of a class this ledger no longer serves into a typed refusal;
//     native_dolt_store.go has no equivalent, so the same read would come back a
//     silent not-found. The guard runs before any id-scoped read is forwarded to
//     the native leaf. See guardNativeIDs.
//
//   - H6 generation split across a write: bd restarts a stopped proxy as a NEW
//     generation while the native pool still points at the old port. A mutation
//     is bracketed by a 200-byte record read, and a generation change stands the
//     native leaf down. See withMutation.
//
//     "A mutation", not "every mutation", and the difference is council B-F3
//     and, one level finer, council pr2 D-F8.
//
//     INSIDE the bracket: every method on the beads.Store surface that writes
//     through the bd leaf (Create, Update, Close, Reopen, CloseAll,
//     SetMetadata, SetMetadataBatch, Tx, Delete, DepAdd, DepRemove —
//     SetLocalString, which writes only the clone-local sidecar file, is
//     deliberately outside; see its doc); every write capability this wrapper
//     implements as a method (ReleaseIfCurrent, DeleteBatch,
//     CreateWithForeignID, CreateWithStorage); and ONE
//     capability handle, ConditionalWriterHandle — but only when it is reached
//     by beads.ConditionalWriterFor on the *ProxiedStore itself, through which
//     UpdateIfMatch, CloseIfMatch, DeleteIfMatch and CompareAndSetMetadataKey
//     are bracketed.
//
//     OUTSIDE it, deliberately: every conditional write reached through a
//     resolver that follows ConditionalWritesResolveTarget first. That is
//     ResolveConditionalWriter (internal/molecule, internal/dispatch,
//     cmd/gc/api_state.go), MetadataCASWriterFor (ApplyMetadataCAS,
//     internal/storebinding's metadata CAS), AtomicConditionalCloserFor — so
//     CloseWithMetadataIfMatch is outside on EVERY path — and every
//     conditional method of a CachingStore over this wrapper, via
//     conditionalBacking(). The target must stay the bd leaf: a wrapper that
//     answered "me" would have to carry the conditional-writes stamp, the
//     capability prober and the state inspector too — a hand-written
//     capability leaf, which is the shape this store is a wrapper to avoid.
//     B-F3 added bracketing adapters for MetadataCASWriterHandle and
//     AtomicConditionalCloserHandle as well; no resolver could reach them, so
//     they were deleted rather than left to be counted as coverage. Also
//     outside: GraphApplyHandle, which must hand out the bd leaf's own applier,
//     because H4 forbids this wrapper claiming any graph-apply interface and
//     cmd/gc's wrapStoreWithBeadPolicies caches the applier at WRAP time.
//
//     On every path outside, the ROUTING is correct (the write is the bd
//     leaf's) and the read-only latch still refuses a native write; what is
//     lost is the staleness half, bounded by the guard tick on a long-lived
//     store and by the next bracketed mutation otherwise.
//
//     Each list is pinned by a test that CALLS it: the INSIDE list by
//     TestProxiedStoreBracketsEveryInsideWriteMethod (every method above,
//     with SetLocalString's exclusion as a row) and
//     TestProxiedStoreBracketsTheConditionalWriteHandles (the
//     ConditionalWriterFor path); the OUTSIDE list by
//     TestProxiedStoreConditionalResolveTargetIsTheDocumentedGap. This used
//     to say the last one "pins both lists"; it pinned one inside path and
//     none of the methods (council pr2 E-I6).
//
// # Demotion
//
// A demoted store is one whose native leaf is closed and nil; its reads serve
// from the bd leaf, which is exactly the store a proxied scope has today. The
// wrapper never promotes itself: a handle that dropped to bd stays there for its
// own lifetime, and recovery is a fresh open (or, for a long-lived store, the
// guard tick's re-pin — which is admitted only after a NON-terminal stand-down;
// see standDown).
