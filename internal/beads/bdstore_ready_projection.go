// ErrReadyProjectionUnsupported is the named degraded state a cache enters when
// its backing store cannot serve the ready projection AT ALL, as opposed to
// having failed to serve it this cycle.
//
// It is a degrade rather than a partial result because it costs the snapshot
// exactly one column: the ROWS are whole, so List/Get/DepList keep serving from
// cache. That distinction is load-bearing — a cache that folds this into
// primePartialErr declines every cache-only read for the life of the process
// and sends each one to a live bd subprocess.
//
// It does NOT mean readiness is unaffected. Without the column every bead's
// IsBlocked is nil, and cachedBeadReady then derives readiness from the bead's
// OWN direct blocks/waits-for/conditional-blocks deps. That predicate is weaker
// than bd's is_blocked, which propagates blocked-ness transitively down
// parent-child edges: a child of a blocked parent reads blocked to bd and ready
// to the cache. The error direction is permissive — the cache would OFFER work
// whose gate has not opened — which for the control dispatcher is worse than
// hiding it (#3218). So readiness reads decline the cache and take their live
// backing.Ready fallback (CachingStore.readyReadsMustGoLive) while every other
// cached read keeps being served.
//
// It is reported exactly once per SCOPE: the verdict is latched in a registry
// keyed by scope path, not on the store object, because cmd/gc rebuilds a store
// per request. Each cache over the scope still learns the verdict — it must, to
// decline its ready reads — but the operator notice and the failing subprocess
// are spent once.

// bd's blocked verb is not a direct-dependency answer. It seeds its row set
// with `SELECT id FROM issues|wisps WHERE is_blocked = 1 AND status <> 'closed'
// AND status <> 'pinned'` (issueops.GetBlockedIssuesInTx) — literally the
// denormalized, transitively-propagated column that bd's own ready filters with
// `is_blocked = 0` (sqlbuild.BuildReadyWorkWhere). Same column, same closure,
// so a child of a blocked parent reads blocked here exactly as it does to
// `bd ready`. That equality is the whole reason this door is allowed to exist:
// a subtly different definition would offer the control dispatcher work whose
// gate has not opened (#3218).
//
// # Absence means not blocked, explicitly
//
// bd returns only blocked rows, so every requested id missing from the response
// is written false rather than left absent. Leaving it absent would leave
// Bead.IsBlocked nil, and cachedBeadReady then falls back to the bead's OWN
// direct blocks/waits-for/conditional-blocks deps — the weaker predicate this
// projection exists to replace. The write is unconditional for that reason.
//
// # The one place it is not the column
//
// After seeding from is_blocked, bd narrows its OUTPUT to rows whose blocker it
// can NAME: an active blocking dep whose target is a resident non-closed row,
// or, failing that, any parent-child edge. A row carrying is_blocked = 1 with
// neither is dropped from the response and therefore reads false here. bd's own
// recompute (issueops.shouldBeBlockedDisjunction) can only produce such a row
// from a stale flag — the state `bd recompute-blocked` and `bd sync` exist to
// repair, and the state issueops.countStaleIsBlockedSQL counts — or from a
// waits-for onto a spawner that closed while its gate stayed shut, which in a
// gc-minted graph is also a molecule step and so carries the parent-child edge
// that attributes it (formula.collectRecipeDeps mints waits-for only between
// steps of one formula). Measured on maintainer-city's hosted-Postgres work
// store: 117 active rows, `bd blocked` names 3, `bd ready` returns 112, and the
// remaining 3 are accounted for by bd's own non-is_blocked ready predicates (2
// in_progress rows, which bd's ready never returns because cmd/bd/ready.go
// hardcodes Status "open", and 1 molecule, which sqlbuild.ReadyWorkExcludeTypes
// drops) — zero unattributable rows.
//
// This is why the SQL door stays primary rather than being replaced: where
// `bd sql` works it returns the column with no attribution filter at all.
//
// # Cost
//
// One subprocess per cache prime and per reconcile, independent of the number
// of beads: bd answers the whole scope in one call the way `bd sql` did. Inside
// bd the work scales with the BLOCKED set, not the ledger — 2·|blocked|
// dependency lookups plus a batched row fetch. Measured against maintainer-city
// live: 2.9s, against a `bd sql` that costs 6.5s there and then fails. What it
// buys is every readiness read between reconciles, which today each spend a
// live `bd ready` at ~2.5-4.4s.
