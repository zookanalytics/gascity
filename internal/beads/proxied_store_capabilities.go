// The ProxiedStore capability surface.
//
// # Why this is a file of its own, and a compile-time contract
//
// Production code discovers optional store capabilities by DIRECT type
// assertion. A wrapper that embedded the Store interface would compile, pass
// every Store-shaped test, and silently strip every one of them — which is the
// hazard splittest/strict_store.go's doc calls out and the reason that type
// carries the same block of `var _ ...` lines. The list below is the executable
// statement of what a caller holding a *ProxiedStore may discover, and removing a
// method from it fails the build rather than a distant behavior test.
//
// # The three rules the routing follows
//
//  1. A capability that READS is forwarded to the CURRENT read leaf — native
//     while it serves, bd after a stand-down. That includes CachingStore's
//     package-private discovery interfaces, which is the whole reason the split is
//     a wrapper and not a hand-written leaf.
//  2. A capability that WRITES resolves on the bd leaf, always. PR2's native
//     handle is read-only latched (P2-06), so even a mis-routed write refuses —
//     but the routing is what makes the refusal unreachable rather than merely
//     caught.
//  3. A capability the wrapper cannot honestly claim is NOT implemented. Two of
//     those are load-bearing and are documented at their (absent) place below:
//     graph-apply (H4) and CachingStore's dependency-snapshot shortcut.
