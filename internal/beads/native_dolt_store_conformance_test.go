// TestNativeDoltStorePinnedIDFenceConformance runs the shared fenced-Create

//
// The SQLite provider has fenced since the contract landed; this one is the
// other half of invariant 16, and until this row existed a workspace binding
// held its namespace claim by convention alone. The hazard is constructible
// today: an infrastructure-only assignment (graph+nudges, say) opens a
// workspace whose Create honors any pinned id verbatim, so one foreign bead
// makes the claim false and leaves that bead unreachable by every id-shaped
// lookup of the namespace it actually sits in.

// The suite's TheForeignIDCreateStaysOpenForTheMigrationCopy and

// ForeignIDCreator, which is right for a suite that cannot demand an optional
// capability — and invisible here. Those two rows are the ones that prove the
// fence leaves the `gc storage migrate` copy path open and that a refusal about
// a disclaimed namespace does not double as a probe for what the store holds.
// Drop CreateWithForeignID and both go quiet while the package still reports ok.
//
// The static `var _ ForeignIDCreator = (*NativeDoltStore)(nil)` next to the
// store catches that same removal at compile time, so on a build that compiles
// this row cannot fail on its own. It is here because the assert is a line
// somebody can delete while removing the method, and because it names the
// consequence — two rows go quiet — which a compile error does not.
