// This file consumes bd's native conditional-release verb, which is what the
// ReleaseIfCurrent SEAM was waiting for.
//
// The release is a compare-and-swap: clear an in-progress assignment only while
// the bead still carries the expected assignee. It used to be assembled as raw
// SQL — `UPDATE issues SET status='open', assignee='' WHERE id=… AND
// status='in_progress' AND assignee=…` — and the verdict was read out of
// rows_affected. That had three costs: the statement had to be built by
// concatenating hand-escaped MySQL string literals, `bd sql` is rejected outright
// in embedded mode (so the path needed a second implementation shelling directly
// to `dolt sql`), and a CAS that matches zero rows is indistinguishable from one
// that could not run.
//
// bd now expresses the same two preconditions natively:
//
//	bd update <id> --if-assignee <expected> --if-status in_progress \
//	               --status open --assignee ""
//
// and — unlike every other bd failure, which is exit 1 with a message — reports
// a failed precondition as its own exit status, 13, having written nothing. The
// CAS verdict is therefore a NUMBER, not a parse of bd's prose. That is the
// whole reason to prefer this verb: the load-bearing branch stops depending on
// message text.
//
// The raw-SQL path stays as the fallback, selected by a per-store latch the
// first time bd rejects the flag as unknown. What reaches it is the
// contract-tested minimum: deps.env BD_PREV_VERSION (1.0.4) predates
// beads#5008, so a store opened against that bd latches and stays there.
//
// The installable default does not reach it. deps.env BD_VERSION is
// v1.3.0, cut from beads main past beads#5008, so on a stock install the
// VERB is the live path and the fallback serves the floor alone. The verb is
// also exercised against the source-built deps.env BD_CURRENT_REF bd
// (make test-bd-conditional-release-contract) — now where the contract is
// homed by choice, not the only cell that can run it.

// bdCASPreconditionExitCode is bd's dedicated exit status for a rejected
// --if-assignee / --if-status precondition: nothing was written, and the verdict
// is "the precondition no longer held", not "the command failed". Every other bd
// failure, including an unresolvable id, is exit 1.

// mutates tst-d6e and reports success. The CAS preconditions are no defense,
// because bd evaluates them against the bead it resolved rather than the one the
// caller named, and a worker usually holds several beads, so a sibling satisfies
// them. That is the incident shape gcy-g4o records ("gcy-dv7" → "gcy-wisp-dv78"),
// and gascity is systematically exposed to it because formula steps run as
// <prefix>-wisp-<suffix> wisps.
//

// costs one read. Only a confirmed collision blocks the release: a plain
// ErrNotFound falls through (the bead may be invisible to the read seam, and the
// verb reaches the same "not held" verdict anyway), and a failed read falls
// through rather than converting a broken read into a refused write — the
