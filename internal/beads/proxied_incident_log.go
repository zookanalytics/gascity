// The proxied-native lane's incident log (council pr2 E-S2).
//
// Every verdict but one is an expected refusal and is deliberately quiet: the bd
// front door is the designed outcome, and a warning per open on every scope of a
// healthy Finite-idle city would be noise an operator learns to ignore.
// head_moved is the exception. It is DETECTION after the fact — the write, if it
// was gc's, has already happened — so its whole value is that somebody is told.
//
// A verdict that is logged at one of the sites that meet it and dropped at the
// others is not detection. The verdict reaches exactly one of three consumers,
// depending on which library open produced it, and each of them logs it here:
//
//   - the factory, for a store's FIRST open (ProxiedIncidentSiteOpen). It used to
//     log through StoreOpenOptions.Logger alone, which the controller's rig
//     stores never set, so on the long-lived open the D-F3 residual says can
//     bite on a busy city the incident left no trace at all;
//   - the split store's read path, for the reopen hook's library open
//     (ProxiedIncidentSiteReadReopen), where the verdict used to become one
//     caller's read error and an unlogged stand-down;
//   - the guard tick's recovery of a stood-down handle
//     (ProxiedIncidentSiteGuardRecovery), which used to turn it into Undecided
//     with no log while doctor went on reporting the stand-down's older reason.
//
// Same message, same attributes, same level at all three, so one grep finds every
// occurrence. A nil logger is slog.Default(): a site that was handed no logger is
// the site that must not go quiet.
