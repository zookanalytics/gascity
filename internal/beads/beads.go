	//
	// City-scoped, not store-scoped. A split city routes by CLASS, so a parent
	// and its child are co-resident only when they classify the same way, and
	// the cases where they do not are ordinary: a graph.v2 workflow whose root
	// is a graph-class molecule in the binding hangs its steps off a work-class
	// bead in a rig ledger. Nothing reconciles the two ledgers, and nothing
	// should — a create that moved the child to reach its parent would mint it
	// under the wrong prefix, which is unfixable afterwards.
	//
	// Weak, therefore, is the contract and not an admission. A store persists
	// and filters this verbatim (Children and ListQuery.ParentID are string
	// matches), and for any id in a namespace it does not serve it must never
	// resolve, validate, rewrite, or place by it. A store that started
	// rejecting an id it cannot see would break every cross-store molecule at
	// once, and a store that started placing by it would strand the child in
	// the parent's namespace, where no later copy can move it.
	//
	// The boundary is drawn at the namespace, not at the field, because that is
	// where the backends can actually agree. A dangling id INSIDE a store's own
	// namespace is a row that store can see the absence of, and the strong
	// backends refuse it before writing anything; the weak ones cannot detect
	// it at all. Which ids count as inside is read off the STORE, not off the
	// child — a row carrying another ledger's prefix (a pinned id, a relic a
	// migration copied in) does not move the boundary — and, on a backend whose
	// library resolves same-prefix dependency targets itself, off the child's
	// prefix as well. What must never be resolved is an id in a namespace
	// neither of those names. That divergence is left explicit rather than
	// papered over — what the conformance suite pins, and what every provider
	// here owes except the one named next, is that a foreign parent is carried
	// without question.
	//
	// MemStore, FileStore, SQLiteStore and the script-backed exec provider
	// carry every parent verbatim, resolving none of them. NativeDoltStore
	// carries a foreign one the same way and additionally refuses a dangling id
	// inside the namespace it serves, before writing anything — the strong
	// reading, which its library forces (issueops resolves a same-prefix
	// dependency target itself, post-commit).
	//
	// The bd-CLI provider (BdStore) is the exception, and it is named rather
	// than implied. It hands this field to bd as --parent on Create and Update,
	// and bd resolves it unconditionally: an id bd cannot see fails the command
	// outright, and one it can see supplies the child's id, so placement follows
	// the parent's namespace instead of the child's class. That is bd's
	// contract, not something this package layers over it, and the provider is
	// left following the tool it drives. Nothing in CI can see the divergence
	// either — the only conformance run over a real bd is skipped (ga-e7z613).
	// ga-6od57 tracks making the provider comply or un-skipping that run; until

//
//   - Every mutated bead carries a nonzero opaque int64 revision. Callers may
//     test it only for equality; arithmetic, ordering across beads, and gap
//     inference are undefined. A token is never intentionally reused during one
//     bead's observed lifetime. A never-mutated bead may read back as zero on a
//     counter-backed store, so zero means "no usable token", not "revisions
//     unsupported".
//   - Every successful mutation of revision-guarded whole-row content —
//     conditional or unconditional — mints a fresh nonzero revision. This
//     covers row-backed Update fields, metadata writes, Close, and Reopen;
//     reads never change it. A same-value update (setting a field to what it
//     already holds) succeeds but may leave the revision unchanged.
//     Separate label/parent persistence and derived or heartbeat fields are
//     outside this guarantee.
//   - Denormalized/derived projection columns are OUTSIDE this guarantee. bd
//     maintains a denormalized is_blocked column on the issue row that other
//     beads' dependency/close/route writes recompute (the same reason bd pins
//     updated_at during that recompute); whether such a derived-state rewrite
//     bumps the revision is backend-dependent and callers must not rely on
//     either answer. This is why every consumer treats PreconditionFailedError
//     as a re-read trigger, never as a conclusion about what changed.
//   - The immediately prior token is stale after a whole-row mutation and is
//     rejected; concurrent writes with the same observed revision have exactly
//     one winner. Backends may generate either counters or random tokens.
//
// GRANULARITY CONTRACT: consumers may assume NEITHER value-level nor
// revision-level conflict semantics. Backends differ — sqlite and the native
// library implement CompareAndSetMetadataKey as server-side value-CAS (an
// unrelated-key write does not conflict); BdStore emulates it over --if-revision
// (an unrelated-key write CAN produce a spurious retry internally). Callers get
// the value-CAS RESULT either way, but must not build timing or interference
// assumptions on top of it.
