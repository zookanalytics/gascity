// closeReopenSpy serves an issue whose status can flip mid-retry, so a replayed
// attempt re-reads current state rather than a frozen snapshot. That is the
// whole point: Close and Reopen re-read inside the attempt, so a replay decides
// from what the store holds now.
//
// The mutate callback controls the status flip independently of the returned
// error, which lets a test model a concurrent writer closing the bead BETWEEN
// attempts. Read that word literally: the callback runs synchronously inside
// the failing attempt, before it returns its conflict, so these tests do not
// exercise backoff timing and deleting the sleep would not turn them red. What
// they do establish is the property that matters, that a replay re-reads and
// short-circuits on state another actor left behind. Testing the timing itself
// would need an injectable backoff, which is not worth building for this.
//
// Note what these tests deliberately do NOT model: a conflict reported after
// this store's own write committed. That cannot happen on this path, because
// every CloseIssue branch commits exactly once (permanent, wisp, and embedded
// alike). See closeOnce's comment in native_dolt_store.go for the per-branch
// argument; do not restate it here, since the two copies drifted once already.
