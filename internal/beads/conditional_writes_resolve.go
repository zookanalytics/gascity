// The conditional-writes resolution seam: the single tested composition point
// of operator policy (the factory-stamped beads.conditional_writes mode) and
// runtime capability (per-store probes). Consumers call
// ResolveConditionalWriter(store) and never see a mode value — the mode is
// stamped onto the store by the beads factory (OpenStoreAtForCity), so a
// caller cannot contradict the store (DESIGN §6.3/§6.4).
//
// The mode type and the enable-AND-capable product live in
// internal/rollout/gate — the dependency-leaf half of internal/rollout —
// because this package cannot import internal/rollout itself
// (rollout → config → orders → beads would cycle).
//
// The seam's diagnostic return is a fresh BeadsDiagnostic value describing the
// degrade/refusal; it reuses the existing PreflightGate/PreflightReason fields
// and NEVER rides the status wire (StatusResponse's beads diagnostic comes from
// StoreOpenResult.Diagnostic exclusively). Keep it that way until the §12.5
// per-store status verdicts land.
