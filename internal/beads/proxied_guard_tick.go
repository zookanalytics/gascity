// The guard tick is the only thing watching a LONG-LIVED proxied handle between
// its reads.
//
// A one-shot command does not need it: the open happens, a few reads follow, the
// process exits, and admission's evidence cannot go stale inside that window in
// any way a read would not itself surface. A controller store is the opposite —
// it is held for the process lifetime, and three things can change under it
// without any read failing at all:
//
//  1. bd replaces its proxy (an operator `bd dolt stop`, an idle expiry, a
//     crash-and-restart). The record names a new generation; the pooled socket
//     may still be connected to the OLD one.
//  2. The scope's root is moved and recreated at the same path (design U22).
//     root_id is path-derived, so the new proxy has the SAME root identity, and
//     the old pooled socket keeps serving the MOVED database without an error to
//     notice. This is the hazard no read can see.
//  3. Somebody migrates the database — bd's own `bd migrate`, or a newer bd
//     opening it — while gc holds a handle whose linked library pins the pair of
//     cursors admission checked.
//
// Rows 1 and 2 are answered by RE-PINNING, not by demoting (design U22,
// 648-654): a bd proxy restart is ordinary operation, and a store that fell to
// the bd front door for the rest of the process on every restart would make the
// whole lane worthless on a Finite-idle city. When the new generation does not
// admit on the tick that sees it, the handle stands down NON-terminally and a
// later tick's recovery re-pins it (council pr2 E-S1): on row 2 the old socket
// keeps serving the moved database, so "leave it and ask again" was serving the
// wrong database for an interval. "A later tick", not "the next": the recovery
// is one probe session per tick, so the handle reads through the bd front door
// until one of those sessions admits — on the loaded box that made the first
// one indeterminate, that can be many intervals (see checkGeneration for what
// that costs against the read-path re-pin it replaced). Row 3 is the one
// demotion the design asks for (563-565), because a cursor pair that moved is a
// fact about the database that re-pinning cannot change.
//
// # Why the tick does not open the library WHILE THE LEAF IS SERVING
//
// A re-pin needs a fresh library handle against the new generation's port, and
// opening one means the hermetic env window: a process-global environment
// mutation under nativeDoltOpenEnvMu. While the native leaf is still serving the
// tick deliberately does NOT perform it. It re-runs ADMISSION (file reads plus
// one probe session — no library, no fork) and then marks the native handle's
// pool stale, so the next READ reconnects through the injected reopen hook on
// the CALLER's goroutine, which is where every other library open in this
// package already happens. A background goroutine that mutated the process
// environment at an arbitrary moment would be a new class of hazard for every
// concurrent scope open and bd-child env build in the process, to save a re-pin
// a few milliseconds.
//
// There is exactly one state where that argument does not hold, and the tick
// does open the library there: a handle that has ALREADY stood down
// non-terminally. Its native leaf is nil, so every read is on the bd leaf and
// the reopen hook cannot be reached by anything — there is no caller's goroutine
// to defer to, only the choice between a recovery and none. See recoverNative.
//
// # What the tick may spend
//
// Per tick: two 200-byte file reads (the record, and the root identity behind
// Validate), one probe session, and — every proxiedGuardOwnerEvery-th tick — a
// /proc read. It holds NO ProviderOps: a tick never forks bd. While the leaf is
// SERVING, an escalation rung is the read path's to spend, through the reopen
// hook, where a caller is waiting for an answer and the cost is attributable.
// Once it has stood down there is no read on the native leaf, so nothing in
// this handle spends one; see recoverNative.
//
// A RECOVERY tick (recoverNative, for a handle that stood down non-terminally)
// is held to the same session budget, and that is a contract on the installed
// NativeLeafReopener rather than something this file can enforce: cmd/gc's
// re-admits with AdmissionInput.ProbeOnce — one pass, at most ONE probe session,
// no sleeps, no drain wait and no no-greeting ladder, because the next tick is
// the retry (council pr2 D-F5). Only when that admits does the tick also open
// the library, inside the hermetic window, plus the post-open re-read: two
// statements on one pinned connection of the new pool (council pr2 E-S3). Before the cap it could cost nine probe sessions
// and ~6s of sleeps per tick against a silent proxy, and the full 60s drain
// against a refusing one, every interval.

		// The record has just said the pinned generation was REPLACED. On a

		// (row 2) the OLD proxy is still alive, still serving the MOVED
		// database on the socket this pool holds, while the new one is not yet
		// accepting — bd writes its record before it binds. Every read on the
		// old socket succeeds, so no read ever reaches the reopen hook: the
		// Undecided arm kept serving the moved database until a tick found the
		// new generation serving, which is one full guard interval at best and
		// has no upper bound at all (GC_BEADS_PROXIED_GUARD_INTERVAL has no
		// ceiling). The old comment's escape hatch — "a reader that needs the
		// new generation sooner re-pins through the reopen hook" — cannot fire
		// on that shape, because the hook is reached only through a failed or
		// stale-marked read.
		//
		// Standing down is what A-F1 forbade, and A-F1 was right at the time:
		// with no recovery path a non-terminal stand-down was permanent. That
		// is no longer true: a non-terminally stood-down long-lived handle is
		// recovered by a later tick through the NativeLeafReopener (see
		// recoverNative). What this arm buys is that no read is served from a
		// generation the record says is gone.
		//
		// What it costs is NOT bounded by one interval, and an earlier version
		// of this comment said it was (round3 review). Every read goes to the bd
		// front door — one fork per read — until some tick's recovery admits,
		// and that recovery is ONE probe session with no provider ops. The
		// session that just failed to admit here is the same kind of session,
		// on the same box: when it failed because the box is loaded (the
		// budget_exhausted this arm usually sees), the next ones tend to fail
		// too, and the handle stays on bd for as long as the load lasts.
		//
		// On row 1 that is a regression against what it replaced. Before this
		// arm the old pool's socket was dead, so the first read failed, reached
		// the reopen hook and re-ran the FULL admission on the reader's
		// goroutine — every pass, the no-greeting ladder, the provider ping —
		// within the read's budget, and re-pinned. Standing the leaf down makes
		// that hook unreachable. The trade is deliberate (a read path that
		// cannot see row 2 must not be the only guard against it), and it
		// fails safe: non-terminal, and never a read from the wrong generation.
		//
		// And on row 1 it can stand down a leaf that was ALREADY right (round3
		// review, safety). When a read meets the dead socket before a tick
		// does, the reopen hook admits the new generation, runs the post-open
		// check and re-points the pool — but it never updates this store's
		// pin (only adoptPin and repin write it). So the next tick still sees
		// "generation moved", re-admits on one session, and on an
		// indeterminate one stands down a leaf serving the correct generation.
		// TestProxiedGuardTickStandsDownALeafTheReadPathAlreadyRepinned pins
