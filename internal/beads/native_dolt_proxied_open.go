// bdEnvPrefix is the namespace bd's own CLI configures itself from. It is not
// the library's namespace (that is beadsEnvPrefix) and gc's direct native opens
// have never had a reason to touch it — a direct scope is one gc configured,
// and bd is not in the loop.
//
// A proxied scope is the opposite: bd owns the proxy, its Dolt child and the
// migration decisions, and gc is opening the linked library against a database
// somebody else administers. Whatever BD_ variables the shell that launched gc
// happened to carry are that shell's opinion about bd's behavior, not gc's
// about the library's, and they must not ride into the window.
const bdEnvPrefix = "BD_"

// proxiedOnlyOpenEnvKeys are the keys the proxied-native window decides that a
// direct native open does not.
//
// They fall into two groups with opposite purposes.
//
// The first five are UNLOCKS, and they are listed so they are guaranteed
// UNSET: a key in an open-env key list whose value the projected map omits is
// actively unset for the window (see withProjectedOpenEnvLocked). bd reads
// BD_ALLOW_REMOTE_MIGRATE and BD_IGNORE_SCHEMA_SKEW to bypass exactly the gate
// gc runs before it admits a proxied database, BD_SMART_GATE and
// BD_EVENTS_JOURNAL change behavior gc has not accounted for, and
// BEADS_TEST_MODE relaxes the library. gc must not be able to migrate or
// schema-skew somebody else's shared database because the operator's shell
// exported an unlock for an unrelated bd command. The BEADS_/BD_ prefix
// withholding already removes all five, so naming them here is belt and braces
// rather than the load-bearing scrub — but it makes the list a complete written
// statement of what the window decides, which is what a reader auditing the
// hermetic claim needs.
//
// The last two are the AUTHOR PAIR, and they are projected with values. They
// are here because the projection reaches commit time, which is not obvious:
// beads' applyConfigDefaults reads GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL during
// the open, latches them onto the store instance, and commitAuthorString feeds
// that latched pair to DOLT_COMMIT(..., '--author', ?). The author is therefore
// pinned AT OPEN and not re-read at commit — so a window that failed to project
// them would attribute a gc write to whoever last ran a git command in that
// shell. PR2 serves no writes, but the pin is what PR3's authorship stands on.

// a listed key the caller's map omits is unset: adding GIT_AUTHOR_NAME there
// would strip an operator's git identity from every direct native open in the
// process, and adding BEADS_TEST_MODE would unset it under the library's own
// test suites. "Flag off is byte-identical" has to mean the direct projection
// is untouched, not merely that the new arm is unreachable.

// OpenNativeDoltStoreAtProxied opens a native Dolt-backed store against a
// database served by bd's proxy, through a hermetic environment window.
//
// The window is one indivisible transition under nativeDoltOpenEnvMu:
//
//  1. withhold the whole BEADS_ and BD_ namespaces, so nothing the ambient
//     shell carries can re-point the open or unlock a migration;
//  2. project env over proxiedNativeOpenEnvKeys, which SETS the endpoint the
//     admission pin resolved and the author pair, and UNSETS every listed key
//     the caller did not name;
//  3. open, read the issue prefix while the env still stands;
//  4. restore both, in reverse.
//
// Holding nativeDoltOpenEnvMu across all four is what makes the process
// environment look atomic to ProcessEnvSnapshotExcludingNativeDoltOpen and to
// AmbientNativeDoltOpenEnv: a concurrent scope open or a bd-child env build
// blocks rather than reading this window's transient values.
//
// It does NOT decide whether the scope may be served natively. That is
// admission's job, which runs first and produces the pin this env is built
// from; this function is the mechanism, and it will faithfully open whatever it
// is pointed at.

// ProxiedOpenedObservation reads, over a library handle gc has just opened and

// pr2 D-F3) and the ignored lane's sentinel reality, which HEAD cannot see
// (council pr2 E-S4) — once the open's own work has finished (council pr2
// E-S3).
//
// It is the post-open half of the observation, and the reason it goes through
// the library's pool rather than through a probe session is the cost: the pool
// already holds a connection the open used, so the re-read is two statements on
// it, with no dial, no handshake and no accepted connection on bd's proxy that
// bd's idle watcher would have to count.
//
// TWO statements, on one pinned connection, because one is not an observation
// of the post-open state (proxyendpoint.ReadPostOpen): the connection the
// library's open-time checks ran on stays pinned to the pre-open session root
// after a non-numbered MigrateUp commit (be-itm5), so its first statement
// answers from BEFORE the open. It used to be
// VersionControlReader.GetCurrentCommit — one SELECT DOLT_HASHOF('HEAD') on the
// pool — which on the read path's reopen was exactly that first statement.
//
// The pool is reached through UnderlyingDB, which every server-mode open's
// *dolt.DoltStore exports (beads v1.3.0 internal/storage/dolt/store.go:3162,
// the accessor bd's own doctor and `bd sql` use). A handle that does not
// export it is reported as an error, not as an empty report: the caller logs
