// Typed classification of a native read failure, ahead of the text table.
//
// # Why a table at all
//
// The read path's original question was binary: "is this the managed-Dolt
// hard-kill/rebind class, so reconnect-and-retry?" It answered by substring
// match over the error's text (nativeDoltTransientReadErrorSignatures), which is
// the right instrument for exactly one thing — a driver that reports the same
// physical condition with a different string on every release.
//
// It is the wrong instrument for everything else, and the proxied-native lane
// makes that concrete. Three of the failures a read over bd's proxy can take are
// facts a retry cannot move (the database is gone, the credentials are refused,
// the linked library's own breaker is open), and one of them — a serialization
// conflict wrapped in ErrCommitIndeterminate — is a shape where retrying is
// itself the hazard. A substring table cannot express any of those, because
// every one of them is identified by a SENTINEL or an error NUMBER that also
// appears inside errors the table already claims.
//
// So the classifier runs first, in a fixed order, and the text table survives as
// the backstop it always was.
//
// # The order, and why each rung is where it is
//
//  1. beadslib.ErrCommitIndeterminate (beads@v1.3.0 beads.go:206). A write whose
//     outcome is unknown must never be replayed automatically. PR2's native lane
//     serves reads only, so this rung is unreachable today — and it is FIRST
//     anyway, because the shape that makes it dangerous is an indeterminate
//     commit that ALSO carries a retryable signature (a 1213 deadlock under a
//     commit whose result never came back). Any later placement would let rung 2
//     claim it and replay a write that may have landed. PR3 inherits the order
//     rather than having to discover it.
//
//  2. A Dolt/MySQL serialization conflict (isNativeDoltSerializationConflict).
//     Known not to have committed, and the existing write path already replays
//     it; a read that hits one is retryable for the same reason. PROXIED LANE
//     ONLY — see "What the classifier does NOT decide".
//
//  3. beadslib.ErrCircuitOpen (beads.go:205). The library refused BEFORE the
//     wire, so there is nothing to reconnect: reconnecting would re-open a pool
//     against an endpoint the breaker has not re-armed for. The answer is to
//     wait the breaker's cooldown inside the read's own budget and ask again.
//     This rung exists because such an error usually has no transient signature
//     at all, so the text table returned it to the caller as if the endpoint had
//     said something about itself. PROXIED LANE ONLY — see "What the classifier
//     does NOT decide".
//
//  4. MySQL 1049 (unknown database) → database_gone, terminal. The proxy served
//     and answered that the database this scope names is not there. No retry, no
//     reconnect: a fresh pool would ask the same question.
//
//  5. MySQL 1045 (access denied) → access_denied, terminal. Same shape, about
//     credentials.
//
//  6. proxyendpoint.IsConnectionLevel (probe.go:356). The sentinel-and-type half
//     of "the endpoint was disturbed": io.EOF, ErrInvalidConn, ECONNRESET,
//     EPIPE, ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTUNREACH, ENETUNREACH, any net.Error or
//     *net.OpError — and, because IsIndeterminate runs first inside it, never a
//     timeout or a cancellation. Reconnect is the right response, which is what
//     the text table was reaching for. PROXIED LANE ONLY — see "What the
//     classifier does NOT decide".
//
//  7. The text table (isNativeDoltTransientReadError), unchanged, as the
//     backstop for a driver string none of the above catches.
//
// Rungs 2, 3 and 6 are the three rungs that would change what the DIRECT native
// lane treats as transient, and all three are gated on the lane. On a direct or
// hosted handle the classifier still differs from main in exactly two places,
// both of them rungs that run AHEAD of the text table and both only for an
// error that ALSO carries one of the nine transient substrings (council pr2
// E-I1):
//
//   - rung 1: an ErrCommitIndeterminate whose text also says, say, "invalid
//     connection" returns on the first pass, where main's text table
//     reconnected and read again;
//   - rungs 4/5: an Error 1049/1045 whose text also says, say, "dial tcp"
//     returns on the first pass as terminal, where main reconnected.
//
// Both are deliberate — an indeterminate commit must never be replayed, and a
// fresh pool asks the same question and gets the same 1049 — and neither was
// reachable from beads v1.3.0's reads when this was written: withReadTx always
// rolls back, wakeExpiredDefers swallows its errors, and no driver path found
// joins 1049/1045 with a transient substring. For every error WITHOUT such a
// mixed signature, rungs 4/5's terminality is the no-op it looks like (the text
// table matches neither, so "terminal" and "unclassified" are the same
// immediate return). TestClassifyNativeDoltReadErrorOrder pins both exceptions.
//
// # What the classifier does NOT decide
//
// It never decides whether a verdict is produced. classifyNativeDoltReadError
// names the endpoint fact; only a handle opened for the proxied lane turns that
// name into a *ProxiedVerdictError (see NativeDoltStore.proxiedReadVerdict). On
// a direct or hosted handle rungs 4 and 5 are still TERMINAL — which is exactly
// what happens on main, since the text table matches neither, so "terminal"
// and "unclassified" are the same immediate return — and the error the caller
// receives is byte-identical to main's, except for the mixed-signature case
// stated above.
//
// # The lane gate, and why rungs 2, 3 and 6 carry one (council B-F1 / C-F1 / C-F5)
//
// An earlier version of this comment claimed rung 6 was the ONLY widening of
// the direct lane. That was false in both directions: two other rungs widened
// it, and rung 6's own widening was not the small one the comment described.
// Every one of the three was a live behavior change on every existing
// hosted/managed-Dolt city — the lane this PR promises not to touch:
//
//   - Rung 3. On main, beadslib.ErrCircuitOpen's text
//     ("dolt circuit breaker is open: server appears down, failing fast") matched
//     none of the nine transient substrings, so the read returned it on the FIRST
//     pass, immediately. Classified as nativeReadCircuitOpen it slept a 5s
//     cooldown and asked again inside a 90s budget — ~18 passes, ~90 seconds of
//     hang per read — and then returned a DIFFERENT error, wrapped in
//     "native Dolt read retry budget exhausted".
//   - Rung 2. On main, isNativeDoltSerializationConflict was consulted on the
//     WRITE path only, and none of its strings is in the transient table, so an
//     Error 1213 on a read returned immediately. Classified as
//     nativeReadTransient every pass calls reconnect() — the injected hook,
//     which on a hosted city re-resolves the managed port with recovery enabled
//     and can restart the Dolt server — roughly 450 times inside one read's
//     budget. Reconnecting is also the wrong remedy: a 40001 says nothing about
//     the connection, and the library has already spent its own serialization
//     retry before gc sees it.
//   - Rung 6 (council C-F5, missed by the first fix round and re-found as pr2
//     D-F2). proxyendpoint.IsConnectionLevel is far wider than the "bare io.EOF
//     plus two errno values" this comment used to describe: it returns true for
//     ANY net.Error and any *net.OpError, and *net.DNSError satisfies
//     net.Error. So a misconfigured BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_HOST on a flag-off
//     direct/hosted city — an instant `lookup x: no such host` on main, because
//     the text table matches none of it — became reconnect-and-retry on the 90s
//     context.Background()-derived budget and returned a rewritten "retry
//     budget exhausted" string. The reconnect is also the wrong remedy for a
//     name that does not resolve: the reopen hook re-resolves the same name.
//
// The `reopen == nil` escape in withReadRetry protects none of them: every
// production direct/hosted open installs a hook (cmd/gc/main.go,
// cmd/gc/api_state.go, internal/storebinding/beadsworkspace/engine.go), so it
// protects only bare test handles.
//
// So all three rungs are gated on the LANE, exactly as rungs 4/5's verdict
// already is. On the direct lane those errors fall through to the text table,
// match nothing, classify as nativeReadUnclassified and are returned verbatim
// on the first pass — the behavior main has. What the direct lane still gets
// from this file is the ORDER (rung 1 ahead of everything, so an indeterminate
// commit is never replayed whatever else it looks like) and rungs 4/5's
// terminality. Neither changes an error or a call count for an error main would
// classify the same way; the two mixed-signature errors it does change are
// stated above.
//
// A claim about this lane is only worth what its test asserts. Each gated rung
// is pinned by a mirror pair over one error that measures what the CALLER sees
// — verbatim error, reopen count, wall time — because any one of those alone
// passes on the un-gated code. See
// TestFlagOffNativeReadIsByteIdenticalForTheLaneGatedRungs.
