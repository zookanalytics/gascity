// bd (v1.3.1) honors it; the retrying removal below stays as the
// backstop for a bd that does not.

// bd's storage layer reads the same flag as a hard guard, so it is not free for
// a workspace bound to a Dolt server (bd init --server-port): with it set to
// "1", bd resolves that workspace to the 127.0.0.1:1 sentinel instead of the
// port the workspace recorded. Runners for such workspaces must override it to
// "0" (BdSubprocessEnv lets a caller's override win).
