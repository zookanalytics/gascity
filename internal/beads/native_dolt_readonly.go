// ErrProxiedNativeReadOnly is the refusal of a native handle opened read-only
// over bd's proxy.
//
// PR2's split store serves reads natively and sends every mutation through the
// bd CLI, because bd owns the proxy, its Dolt child, the migration decisions
// and the event hooks. A native write on such a scope would bypass all four.
var ErrProxiedNativeReadOnly = errors.New("native Dolt store opened read-only over bd's proxy")

// WithProxiedReadOnly latches a native handle read-only for its whole lifetime.
//
// The fence is a FIELD on *NativeDoltStore and a one-line guard on each
// mutating method, deliberately, rather than a hand-written read-only leaf type
// that forwards the reads.
//
// A leaf type is the obvious design and it is the wrong one here, because
// capability in this package is discovered by type assertion. *NativeDoltStore
// answers to a long tail of optional interfaces — conditional writes, graph
// apply, foreign-id creates, parent-projection waiting, the row witness — and
// CachingStore alone asserts three PACKAGE-PRIVATE ones that a type outside
// this file could not even name. Every interface a hand-written leaf forgot
// would go silently missing: no compile error, no test failure, just a
// capability that stops being found. splittest's strict store exists because
// that has already happened once.
//
// A field costs one branch per mutation and cannot lose an interface, because
// there is no new type. PR3's delta is to stop setting it — by asking, with a
// WithProxiedWritable() that a reviewer can see in a diff, rather than by
// omitting this option: OpenNativeDoltStoreAtProxied sets readOnlyReason
// STRUCTURALLY (council B-F5), so this option is now belt to that braces and
// the one that matters for a handle built by hand in a test.
//
// This is the SECOND of the two read-only fences, and the belt to the other's
// braces: the first is that the split wrapper does not implement the graph-apply
// interfaces at all, so policy middleware never routes an ephemeral create
// here. This one holds if a bare native leaf ever escapes the wrapper.

// ReadOnlyReporter is a store that can say whether it refuses mutations.
//
// It exists so a WRAPPER can forward the answer instead of swallowing it. Every
// wrapper in the tree embeds the Store interface, which hides this method, and a
// hidden mutation fence is worse than an absent one: a caller that asks "is this
// handle read-only" gets "no" from a wrapper around a handle that refuses every
// write.

// unguarded because PR3 clears the latch on a live handle, and a field that is
// written once "before anyone could see it" today is the kind that grows a race
// the day somebody makes it dynamic.
