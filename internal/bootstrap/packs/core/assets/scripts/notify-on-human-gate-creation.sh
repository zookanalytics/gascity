# notify-on-human-gate-creation — mail + nudge the addressee when a human
# gate bead is created.
#
# Creating a `type=human` gate produces ZERO notification: `gc bd gate create`
# builds the gate bead, adds the blocks edge, commits, prints to stdout, and
# returns. Nobody tells the human who must resolve it. The only gate watcher
# (`gc bd gate check`) skips human gates entirely (they "need manual
# resolution"). Doctrine papers over the gap by hand ("on the predecessor
# close, mail+nudge the addressee"); this order ships that reflex.
#
# It subscribes to bead.created events. For each newly-created bead whose
# issue_type is `gate` it re-fetches the bead (`gc bd show --json`) — the
# event payload does not carry await_type — and, when the gate is an OPEN
# `human` gate, resolves the addressee and notifies them once. Idempotent:
# a given gate is notified at most once. Dedup state lives in
# $GC_PACK_STATE_DIR/notify-on-human-gate-creation-state.json, so it is both
# city- and pack-scoped — multi-city installs never cross-pollinate.
#
# Addressee resolution (first non-empty wins):
#   1. the gate's assignee
#   2. gc.deferred_assignee metadata (formula/molecule gates strip the
#      assignee here at create time, molecule.go stripDeferredAssignee)
#   3. $GC_ESCALATION_RECIPIENT (default "human")
#
# Notification rides `gc mail send --notify`, which mails the addressee and
# nudges them when they are a real session — and deliberately skips the
# tmux-nudge for the "human" recipient (humans have no session to poke;
# cmd_mail.go guards `to != "human"`). That is the one wrinkle a naive
# "nudge the assignee" would trip on.
#
# Loud-fail (gastownhall/gascity#4543): an undeliverable send is NOT recorded
# as done, and the script exits NON-ZERO when any send failed. The exit code is
# load-bearing — the controller captures an exec order's combined output but
# only logs it on a non-zero exit (order_dispatch.go), so a fire-and-forget
# exit 0 would swallow the failure. It never silently evaporates. Retry: the
# controller persists the bead.created cursor before the run, so this order
# retries a failed gate only opportunistically (another bead.created within the
# lookback window re-queries the same window); the companion staleness sweep is
# the guaranteed backstop — it re-notifies any human gate still open past the
# threshold, so a persistently-undeliverable gate is not lost.
#
# Cross-rig gate beads within a city are supported via a prefix->rig lookup
# so `gc bd show` is scoped to the rig that owns each gate. The read routes
# through `gc bd` (not bare `bd`) so the wrapper runs bd in the owning rig's
# directory; `--rig` is a gc flag, not a bd flag. Mail send is city-scoped:
# recipients (mayor / human / coordinators) are city-level identities.
#
# Runs as an exec order (no LLM, no agent, no wisp).
