# renudge-stale-human-gates — re-mail + re-nudge the addressee of a human gate
# that has stayed OPEN past a staleness threshold, repeating on an interval.
#
# notify-on-human-gate-creation notifies the addressee ONCE, at creation. A
# human gate that is created, notified, and then left unresolved gets no
# further reminder: the creation mail scrolls off, the human forgets, and the
# only gate watcher (`gc bd gate check`) skips human gates entirely. Doctrine
# papers over the gap by hand ("a human gate open past a threshold gets
# re-nudged, repeating on the interval"); this order ships that reflex, and it
# is also the safety net for a creation notify that was undeliverable beyond
# its short lookback window.
#
# Runs as a cooldown sweep. Each run:
#   1. Enumerates OPEN gates across HQ and every rig (`gc bd gate list` is
#      open-only by default), keeping only await_type == "human" gates.
#   2. For each human gate whose age exceeds GC_STALE_GATE_THRESHOLD and whose
#      last re-nudge is older than GC_STALE_GATE_RENUDGE_INTERVAL, re-fetches
#      the gate (the list projection omits assignee/metadata), re-verifies it
#      is still an open human gate, resolves the addressee and re-notifies.
#
# Addressee resolution (first non-empty wins), identical to the creation notify
# so a gate is always re-nudged at the same address it was first notified:
#   1. the gate's assignee
#   2. gc.deferred_assignee metadata (formula/molecule gates strip the
#      assignee here at create time, molecule.go stripDeferredAssignee)
#   3. $GC_ESCALATION_RECIPIENT (default "human")
#
# Notification rides `gc mail send --notify`, which mails the addressee and
# nudges them when they are a real session — and deliberately skips the
# tmux-nudge for the "human" recipient (humans have no session to poke;
# cmd_mail.go guards `to != "human"`).
#
# Loud-fail (gastownhall/gascity#4543): an undeliverable send surfaces to the
# controller log (stderr) and is NOT recorded, so the next sweep retries it. It
# never silently evaporates.
#
# Dedup / cadence: per-gate last-re-nudge state lives in
# $GC_PACK_STATE_DIR/renudge-stale-human-gates-state.json (city- and
# pack-scoped). An entry is refreshed on every successful re-nudge, so a live
# stale gate's entry never ages past the retention window; a resolved gate stops
# being refreshed and is pruned after GC_STALE_GATE_STATE_RETENTION. This
# retention-based prune (rather than pruning to the current open set) keeps the
# cadence memory intact across a transient per-rig enumeration failure, so a
# rig that briefly fails to list does not trigger an early re-nudge storm.
#
# Cross-rig: gates are enumerated per scope (HQ + each non-HQ rig), so the
# owning rig is known without a prefix lookup; the re-fetch is scoped with
# `--rig` (a gc flag, not a bd flag, so it routes through `gc bd`). Mail send is
# city-scoped: recipients (mayor / human / coordinators) are city-level
# identities.
#
# Runs as an exec order (no LLM, no agent, no wisp).
