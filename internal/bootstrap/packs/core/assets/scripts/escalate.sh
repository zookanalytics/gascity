# Wake the recipient when it is an agent session. Without this the send writes
# a message bead and emits an event with no subscriber, so a paused agent finds
# the escalation only on a turn boundary it may never reach — which is how a
# maintenance advisory can fire on schedule for a day and reach nobody.
#
# `human` is the exception: it names an operator inbox with no session behind
# it, so there is nothing to wake and the flag would fail against it.
#
# The send is bounded because a wake can outlive the send it follows, and an
# escalation hanging here would stall the maintenance run that raised it. The
# mail is already written by the time the wake blocks, so a bound that trips
# costs the wake and not the message. Delivery is best-effort either way, so
# nothing that must survive belongs only in this mail.
