// substitutionFloor is the shortest value [RedactSecrets] will substitute.
// Substitution is blind to word boundaries, so hiding a short value mangles
// unrelated text: with "no" a secret, herdr's "agent not found" becomes
// "agent <redacted>t found", and [IsSessionGone] decides by matching that phrase
// — a redactor silently taking over branches that turn a tolerated missing
// session into a hard failure. (The herdr client used to decide the same way and
// now gates on herdr's reported error code instead, for a related reason: the
// rendered text it was matching also carried the argv it had passed in.)
//
// The floor buys that back because the two populations barely overlap: the
// credentials that reach a session are long (the instance token is 32 hex
// characters, an Anthropic key and a GitHub token both run past 30), while the
// values that shred text are short function words. 8 is the low end of that gap
// — long enough that no English word or shell token in an error message is
// swallowed whole, short enough to still cover anything a minting routine
// produces. It is not a proof: a user-configured secret below the floor stays
// legible in text this process did not write, and an inert value above it can
// still collide with a matched phrase. Both are recorded in the callers.

// travel in a world-readable argv", where the conservative answer for an
// unknown name is no and the cost of a false positive is a temp file. Redaction
// asks "would hiding this value destroy the message", where the cost of a false
// positive is the diagnostic itself. These names are the standard POSIX process
// environment: every one is set on the controller, every one holds a substring
// of almost any path a failing command prints, and none of them authenticates
// anything. Scrubbing against them turns a pre_start failure into a wall of
// <redacted> — a leak fix becoming a diagnostics outage.
//
// They are deliberately NOT in [envArgvSafe]. Listing them there would also
// widen argv routing, so a pack that set PATH or HOME as session env would
// start passing it as a process argument — a silent behavior change on a
// question this file exists to answer conservatively.

// gone before [RedactSecretsTail] ever sees it, and its tail then survives into
// the reported text unmatched.
//
// So the number is a claim about the population, not a comfort margin. API keys
// and bearer tokens run well under 100 bytes, but this package's whole posture
// is that an unrecognized variable holds credential material, and that
// population is much larger: Kubernetes service-account and OIDC JWTs reach
// 850-1200 bytes routinely, a base64 service-account blob more, an RSA-4096 PEM
// about 3.2KB. 1024 covered the tokens and quietly failed the rest. 8192 clears
// every shape actually used to authenticate; the buffer is transient and one
// per setup command, so the memory is not worth trading against a partial
// credential in a durable error.
//
// Anything longer still straddles. [OutputTailRetention]'s callers hold whole
// values, not lengths, so bounding this exactly would mean plumbing a
// max-secret-length hint down from each caller — tracked as ga-y2m41 rather
// than guessed at here.

// The order is the point. Substitution matches whole values, so redacting after

// suffix no longer matches its own secret, so nothing downstream can catch it.
// That renders a near-complete token verbatim, reachable from any command whose
// output merely runs past the limit. Redacting the whole buffer first costs
// nothing, because the buffer is already in hand.
//
// It is why a caller retaining a tail must keep [OutputTailRetention] bytes
