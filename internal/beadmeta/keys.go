// Package beadmeta is the single named home for Gas City's engine-owned
// bead-metadata key vocabulary — the "gc." namespace written into and read
// from bead.Metadata across the workflow engine, role workers, CLI, and API.
//
// Before beadmeta, these keys were ~126 raw string literals scattered across
// ~70 files with no central declaration: the real interface between modules was
// folklore. This package makes the seam named and compiler-checked. It imports
// only the standard library, so every workflow package can import it without
// risk of an import cycle, mirroring internal/events.
//
// Scope: this package owns engine-touched bead-metadata KEY NAMES only. It
// deliberately excludes (each a separate owner): gc.* event-type names
// (internal/events.KnownEventTypes), telemetry metric names (internal/telemetry),
// JSON schema-version contract strings (e.g. gc.dolt.cleanup.v1), and the
// t3bridge UI thread-metadata namespace (internal/runtime/t3bridge). Pack- and
// prompt-private keys that no Go file reads stay open-world by design and are
// intentionally NOT declared here (see KnownMetadataPrefixes for the dynamic
// gc.var.<name> case).
//
// A const block (not a runtime registry) is the right mechanism: bead.Metadata
// is map[string]string with no runtime decode/codegen consumer, so the
// events.RegisterPayload reflect-based machinery would add init-ordering cost for
// no benefit. Drift is enforced statically by the AST guard in guard_test.go.
//
// Cross-repo note: bd (the beads backend) stores these keys as opaque JSON in
// its generic issues.metadata column and never interprets them — the key
// names are 100% gascity-minted vocabulary, so changing bd's schema does not
// require touching this package and vice versa. See
// engdocs/design/beads-dolt-contract-redesign.md for the storage contract.

// SessionAffinityMetadataKeys are the metadata keys that pin a work bead to a
// particular live session through continuation-group routing. They must be
// cleared together whenever work is rerouted off its original session without a
// preserved assignee (retry-to-pool, reopen-source, orphan/closed/retired-session
// release); otherwise a later claim re-vacuums the bead onto an unrelated
// session via the stale group. Both cmd/gc and internal/dispatch consume this
// single list so a new affinity key cannot silently fix one clear path while
// leaving another stale.
//
// Of these keys, ContinuationGroupMetadataKey is the active routing vector: the
// hook claim path reads it to vacuum open, unassigned sibling work onto the
// claiming session. SessionAffinityMetadataKey is currently an advisory marker —
// it is written (e.g. internal/dispatch/drain.go) but no Go routing path reads
// it yet, so it is cleared alongside the group for hygiene and future-proofing
// rather than because it gates routing today.
