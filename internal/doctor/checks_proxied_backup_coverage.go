// ProxiedBackupCoverageCheck states, once per city, that its bd-owned proxied
// scopes have no backup at all.
//
// The per-scope checks cannot say it. `rig:<name>:dolt-backup` returns OK
// because neither of its two signals can ever exist on a proxy root, and
// bd-backup-freshness skips a scope with no backup_state.json and delegates
// the "no backup at all" signal to the dolt-backup check by name. Between them
// a default-topology city reads as fully covered while nothing — not gc, not
// bd, not the backup dog — can produce a recovery point: bd v1.3.0
// refuses `backup` on the proxied path, and mol-dog-backup talks to the
// managed server, which a proxied scope does not have.
//
// It is an advisory, not a warning: a proxied city is a healthy city on this
// branch and there is no action the operator can take on v1.3.0, so a warning
// would be a permanent red line nobody can clear. The honest thing is one
// line that names the exposure and what will close it.
