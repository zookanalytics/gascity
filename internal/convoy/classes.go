// MemberClasses names the class handles a single convoy operation spans.
//
// Convoy membership is the one deliberately mixed-class relation in the bead
// substrate: the convoy bead and its `tracks` edges are owned by Work — every
// convoy is a work bead, the synthetic formula/drain ones included — while the
// members themselves can be owned by another class. Per the class-ownership
// table only Work and Graph ever own convoy members, so those are the only
// classes an operation can name here; Sessions, Messaging, Orders and Nudges are
// non-participating by construction rather than by a runtime skip.
//
// Naming is the whole contract, in both directions:
//
//   - A class the caller does not name does not participate. It is never read,
//     contributes an EMPTY result, and can never turn a lookup into an error.
//   - A class the caller does name participates. Its read failures are returned
//     with the class as provenance and are never flattened into "member not
//     found", because an unreachable owner and a deleted bead must not look
//     alike.
//
// This is explicit composition, not federation: there is no registry, no
// probing for a provider, and no first-match ownership. Candidate handles come
// from the caller, ownership is proven before any mutation, and a bead owned by
// two named handles is a typed error rather than a silent winner.
type MemberClasses struct {
	// Convoy is the handle for the class that owns the convoy bead itself and
	// its membership edges. It is required: every convoy operation reads or
	// writes the convoy's own edges through it, and it is also the first
	// candidate probed for members (a same-class convoy owns its members).
	Convoy beads.Store

	// Work names the Work-class scopes whose beads can be members. Work is a
	// topology, not one store — the HQ workspace plus each rig workspace — so
	// it is a slice; a caller that spans only the HQ scope names one handle.
	// Nil or empty means this operation does not span the Work class.
	Work []beads.Store

	// Graph names the Graph-class handle when graph-class beads (formula steps,
	// control beads, wisp roots) can be members. It is never the class that owns
	// the convoy itself — synthetic convoys are work beads like every other
	// convoy. Nil means this operation does not span the Graph class.
