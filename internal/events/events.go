// Package events provides tier-0 observability for Gas City.
//
// Events are infrastructure records of what happened (agent lifecycle,
// bead operations, controller state). The recorder writes JSON lines to
// .gc/events.jsonl; the reader scans them back. Recording is best-effort:
// errors are logged to stderr but never returned to callers.
//
// Agent observation data (messages, tool calls, thinking) is read directly
// from provider session logs via the sessionlog package, not the event bus.
