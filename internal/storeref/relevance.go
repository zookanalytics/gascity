// Relevance: which legs of a plan a caller's question can be answered from.
//
// # Why this is not a leg order
//
// The obvious way to make the controller's hot reads cheap is to put the
// binding first and stop at the first hit. It is also the way that recreates the
// D6 divergence in reverse: Plan(RoutedWork) puts the binding LAST on purpose
// (#5148), because binding-last is what makes a co-resident id answer from the
// work store on the demand side and from the work store on the claim side. A
// consumer that reorders the plan for itself has silently disagreed with every
// other consumer about which copy of a dual-resident bead is the real one.
//
// So the descriptor NARROWS and never reorders. A narrowed plan is a
// subsequence of its parent: same modes, same roles, same per-leg error
// policies, same relative order — with legs this plane may not read removed.
// That is a property, not a convention: TestNarrowKeepsPlanOrderAndOnlyDropsLegs
// asserts the subsequence directly, and the conformance corpus pins the rendered
// rows.
//
// # The plane doctrine
//
// The plane is a property of the CALLER, and the two are deliberately NOT
// complements.
//
//   - The RUNTIME plane is city operations: ticks, hooks, claims, sweeps,
//     census. It is a LATENCY contract, and it narrows to the infra/class
//     binding: an infrastructure-class read on this plane hits the binding
//     only (operator invariant 2026-08-15, bd memory
//     gascity-runtime-infra-store-invariant, ga-l7jdg). It is why a claim needed
//     a 240s window and why one tick leg cost 185s of a 360s tick.
//
//     One tick read is deliberately NOT on this plane: the default pool-demand
//     probe (cmd/gc routedWorkCityDemandLegs) counts routed work over
//     Plan(RoutedWork) on the RECONCILE plane — the work ledger, then the
//     binding. `gc sling` and formula dispatch stamp gc.routed_to on
//     WORK-class beads, which live in the ledger, and the claim reader
//     (`gc ready`) federates the unnarrowed plan and serves them. A demand
//     count narrowed to the binding is therefore a claimable bead counted by
//     nobody, and the pool never spawns for it (#6019). The cost is one ready
//     read of the ledger per tick per city (the per-pass demand cache shares it
//     across pools) — the same read a city that relocates nothing pays every
//     tick. A work-ledger leg on any OTHER runtime-plane read is still a
//     misrouting bug, not a cost to amortize.
//   - The RECONCILE plane is the rare, separately-scheduled convergence lane. It
//     is a CONVERGENCE contract and narrows NOTHING, because a store it skips is
//     a store nothing converges: the runtime plane over that same binding is
//     delta-only, so one dropped journal event would strand a binding-resident
//     bead permanently.
//
// # Where the descriptor is applied, and why it is not applied in Plan()
//
// Plan() answers "which stores can hold the answer to this question". That is a
// residency fact about the CITY and it does not change when a different process
// asks. The plane is a fact about the CALLER. Keeping the two separable is what
// lets one topology serve both lanes, lets a corpus row show the full plan and
// its narrowing side by side, and lets the convergence lane converge exactly the
// legs the runtime lane refused.
//
// # Why this surface needs no new boundary-guard row
//
// scripts/residency-boundary-patterns.txt ratchets every way a consumer can get
// STORES out of a plan and read them itself — the `[]beads.Store` literal, the
// `.Leg.Store` disassembly, and EachLeg, the sanctioned enumeration seam. Narrow
// hands back a ResolvedPlan, the same type Plan already returns, so a consumer
// still runs it through Union/Walk and the leg order and per-leg error policy are
// still applied by the executor. There is no new way to hold a leg list, so there
// is nothing new to count.
//
// # Per-template relevance is deliberately NOT a field here
//
// The original shape of this surface (ga-4qdfn item 1) was per-TEMPLATE leg
// relevance: the topology knows which stores a given pool's routed work
// materializes into, so a template whose formulas mint into the binding could
// have its legs narrowed to the binding. The operator invariant supersedes it:
// on the runtime plane the answer is the binding for EVERY template, so a
// per-template field would vary nothing this build can produce. It goes in when
// a plane needs two different answers for two templates, and not before.

// A city that relocates no class has no binding, and there its work store IS its

// every single-store city. The same degradation covers a city whose binding
// resolved back to its work store: the plan's own dedupe already collapsed them,
// so there is one leg and it is both.
