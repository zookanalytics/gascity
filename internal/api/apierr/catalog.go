// The catalog: every machine-readable problem type the API emits, registered at
// package init. Keep this the single reviewable taxonomy file. Codes are
// generic by default (bead-not-found, not bead-N-not-found) and refined only
// where a client must branch differently (two distinct 409 conflicts). Adding a
// code is additive; removing or renaming one is a breaking change.
//
// The three sling-* URNs are frozen: they are already public in the OpenAPI spec
// via x-gascity-problem-types and must stay byte-identical.
