// RunStatus is the closed lifecycle state of a run on the canonical Run
// resource. It converges the several run-status vocabularies the API historically
// exposed (workflow-run projection, orders monitor feed, dashboard lane phases)
// into ONE machine-branchable enum. The schema is closed (Huma emits `enum`), so
// a consumer can switch exhaustively.
//
// The full set is fixed here from the first slice so no schema break lands as the
// derivation grows: `waiting` is emitted for a run blocked on an open dependency;
// `canceling`/`canceled` are emitted once cancellation (POST .../cancel) is
// wired. `canceled` is always a terminal outcome distinct from `failed` and
// `skipped`.
