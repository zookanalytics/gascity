//
// Each names a rig, because that is what gives it a store to read history
// from: orderStoreInfosForState resolves a rig-scoped store first, and an
// order naming neither a rig nor a city store yields no store info at all, so
// the history read is skipped and the fan-out this file measures never
// happens.

// it most. Building this body costs one labeled bead List per order per
// store, and the endpoint's readers are pollers: the SBF observability
// exporter reads it once a minute. On the two production cities the sequence
// advanced about six times a minute, so an entry stored under one index was
// never looked up under that index again, and every poll paid the full
// rebuild — 5.8-11.1s on a 23-order city, 14.2-22.4s on a 26-order one,
// against the exporter's 5s per-call timeout. Its collector marks a city down
// when any single endpoint fails, so both cities reported unreachable while
