//     same relative order, so on a rig-less city the two sequences agree.
//     GET /v0/beads federates the same legs in the same order.
//   - Within a leg: whatever order that leg's own Ready reader emits. For a
//     work store (CachingStore.Ready) and for the canonical relocated binding
//     (beads.SQLiteStore.Ready) alike that is the canonical (priority ASC,
//     created_at ASC, id ASC) order, so each leg is sorted on its own.
//   - Dedupe: first leg to return an id wins. The graph leg runs last, so a bead
//     co-resident in the work store and the binding — the documented steady
//     state of a migrated city, where the migration preserves ids and never
//     deletes back — resolves to the work store's row on both endpoints.
//   - Merged order: leg concatenation, deliberately NOT re-sorted. A global
//     re-sort would change the bytes a multi-rig single-store city already
//     serves, and the graph leg must be free for such a city. Both sides are
//     therefore compared after normalizing with beads.SortBeadsReadyOrder. That
//     normalization is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, because a
//     concatenation of sorted legs is not itself sorted; it is well-defined
//     because SortBeadsReadyOrder is a total order over the merged set.
//   - Failure: a rig degrades (Partial 200 + partial_errors); the graph leg
//     does not (503, carrying any work-leg errors recorded before it). See
//     graphPlaneUnavailable.
//   - Tier: every leg is read at beads.FederatedReadTier, stated explicitly.
//     A no-argument Ready() left TierMode at its zero value, which the work
//     legs' bead-policy layer rewrote to TierBoth while the unwrapped graph leg

// workflow root or scope at once through beads.Store.CloseAll rather than
// through a per-bead route — run cancel and workflow delete/purge here, and the
// convoy-cleanup and scope-abort paths on the CLI and dispatch side. They select
// the subtree by gc.root_bead_id with no gc.kind filter, so they do close beads
// this contract otherwise covers, and they are ungated symmetrically on both
// planes rather than leaking on one. That is deliberate: they stamp the disjoint
// control-plane gc.outcome vocabulary (canceled, skipped) precisely because the
// close does not assert completion — see skipScopeMembers in internal/dispatch —
// and requiring a work record would make a run uncancellable and a workflow
// impossible to tear down under enforcement. None is an escape hatch for a
// refused per-bead close: each tears down an entire subtree rather than one bead.
