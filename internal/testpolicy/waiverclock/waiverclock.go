// Package waiverclock defines the one fleet-wide policy for how dated
// test-policy waivers are enforced against the wall clock.
//
// Three ledgers carry dated waivers: the runtime provider ledger
// (internal/testutil/providerledger), the resource census
// (internal/testpolicy/resourcecensus), and the beads conformance skips
// (internal/beads/beadstest). Each exports its dates as Expiry values, and the
// never-cached internal/testpolicy/waiverexpiry check is the only caller that
// passes them to Check with today's date. That check is untagged, runs in the
// unit-core job, and that job runs in .githooks/pre-push. So an expiry date
// passing turns every Go-touching push in the fleet red with no code change
// involved. That happened on 2026-08-12 and again on 2026-08-26, and each time
// it was cleared by whoever happened to be blocked rather than by the waiver's
// owner.
//
// The fix is not to weaken the ratchet. It is that an expiry should fail the
// OWNER, not every bystander. This package draws the line: structural defects
// stay fatal everywhere, because they can only appear with a code change, while
// a lapse gets a bounded grace period during which it warns and names its owner,
// and a strict mode that the owner's own lanes run.
//
// All ledgers share these semantics so they cannot drift apart the way a shared
// date already did.
