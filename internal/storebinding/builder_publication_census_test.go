// No consumer may obtain a StoreSet before activation publishes one. Three layers
// enforce that, and it is worth being exact about which one closes what.
//
//  1. The type system closes every route Go's own rules police. Assembly is
//     unexported and returns UnpublishedStoreSet, never StoreSet, so the only
//     function anywhere that yields a populated set is Publish, and Publish
//     demands an authority whose sole mint is unexported. No import, alias, or
//     composite literal reaches around that, and it holds without anyone
//     running a test.
//  2. The go:linkname ban is what closes the rest, because go:linkname is
//     outside the type system entirely: a bodyless declaration bound to another
//     package's symbol needs no import, honors no exportedness, and is never
//     type-checked. Measured on this code, one pull of the old exported
//     constructor yielded a usable StoreSet outright; one pull of the current
//     assembler yields only an unpublishable candidate, but a second pull of
//     the unexported mint publishes it. Nothing expressible in Go stops that —
//     an unforgeable token would be read out of the package by the same
//     mechanism — so the mechanism itself is banned. That ban is a closure
//     rather than a fourth blocklist entry because a directive is lexical: the
//     compiler matches raw comment text, which admits no escape sequence,
//     alias, or import name to hide behind, so there is no second spelling to
//     chase.
//  3. These censuses keep the assembly, mint, and publish call sites where the
//     the design put them, and pin the type-system invariant of layer 1 so a later
//     slice cannot quietly reintroduce a second producer.
//
// The censuses are module-wide by subject — this package plus every non-test
// file that imports it, under any import name and any legal spelling of the
// import path — and every one of them fails closed: an empty subject set is a
// broken census, not a pass. Every evasion found in review is pinned in
// TestCensusSeesEveryKnownEvasion so none can regress silently.
