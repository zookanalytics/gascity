// The Graph logical witness (the witness contract).
//
// The witness is the provider-neutral half of a migration proof: a digest over
// a canonical stream of the class's LOGICAL content, carrying no provider,
// format, path, schema version, or physical identity. Two stores holding the
// same graph produce the same digest whatever they are made of, which is what
// makes "the destination equals the source" checkable across a provider
// change. The physical half is the descriptor envelope, and it is never
// compared across providers.
//
// It is computed through the closed storebinding.GraphStore contract, not
// through SQL. That is the point rather than a convenience: a witness built
// from this provider's tables could only ever compare against itself, and an
// exporter reaching past the front door for rows would be the generic-store
// escape AC 2 forbids.
//
// Completeness, not non-emptiness, is what the stream has to prove. Three
// mechanisms do it, each independently blocking: every record family is
// emitted with its count even when the count is zero, so a destination that
// lost a whole family produces a different stream rather than a matching one;
// dependency edges are cross-checked in both directions, so a store that
// imported beads but lost edge state blocks instead of hashing equal; and the
// allocator floors are hashed as logical values, so a destination that
// re-mints from zero fails before it can collide.
//
// References carry a typed kind (the witness contract). The Graph class
// legitimately points outside itself — at Work and Sessions beads, and at
// declared-external targets — so "the endpoint is not in this store" is not by
// itself a fact about damage. Each edge is therefore classified from what its
// endpoints DECLARE, never from what happens to be resident, and the kind is
// hashed alongside the tuple. That ordering is what makes the digest an
// equality proof: an edge contributes the same bytes whether or not the class
// it points into was loaded, so two stores holding the same graph agree even
// when the rest of the StoreSet differs, while a change of kind is a change of
// graph and moves the digest. Resolution is still required where the class is
// the authority — an endpoint in Graph's own namespace must be present, or the
// witness blocks.
