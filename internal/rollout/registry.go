package rollout

// This file is the canonical rollout-gate registry. It is CODEOWNERS-gated: a
// human owner reviews every Spec addition, Expires extension, and Category
// classification.
//
// The litmus for adding a gate here (all must hold, else it does not belong):
//  1. It selects between two MECHANICAL code paths (SelectsBetween), not agent
//     behavior — nothing a prompt could express, nothing a smarter model obviates.
//  2. It is terminal: a rollout/migration gate names when it dies (Expires +
//     VersionAnchor). Only a killswitch is long-lived.
//  3. Its value lives in its owning config section, read through internal/config;
//     this package never imports the consumer.

// ptr returns a pointer to v — the local literal helper for Default arms.
func ptr[T any](v T) *T { return &v }

// specs is the canonical registry. It is unexported so no test can append a
// phantom Spec that leaks into a sibling's ForTest defaults.
