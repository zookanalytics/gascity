// load_verdict: gc.attempt == iteration), and #5635 briefly stamped a retry
// child's own counter there instead, which left those loops iterating forever
// from iteration 2 on. The retry counter lives in gc.retry_attempt: it starts
// at 1 in every iteration and is bounded by the child's own gc.max_attempts, so
