// ExtractTailUsage reads the tail of a session transcript and returns one

// of usage — so entries sharing a message.id are collapsed to a single
// TailUsage (the last entry observed wins). Entries without a message.id
// stand alone. Entries without a uuid or with all-zero usage are skipped;
// malformed lines are tolerated silently (mirroring ExtractTailMeta). The
// scan window is the last tailChunkSize bytes, so usage that scrolled past
// the window is not returned.

// maxUsageScanBytes caps how far ExtractTailUsageSince will grow its scan
// window when it cannot reach the cursor entry. It bounds the worst case (a
// long-lived transcript whose cursor is stale or absent) while still covering
// transcripts orders of magnitude larger than the fixed tail window.
//
// The cap is a latency budget as much as a memory one. Both production callers
// run synchronously: the prompt-op return path (worker.recordInvocationTelemetry,
// deferred from Message and Nudge) and the deadline-bounded controller reconcile
// tick (worker.Factory.SweepSessionModelUsage, which sweeps every terminal
// session per tick). Each doubling re-reads AND re-parses the whole window, so
// growing to a given size costs roughly twice that size in reads plus JSON
// parsing. Measured against the ~1.5ms fixed 64KB window: ~85ms at 2MB, ~271ms
// at 5.9MB, ~680ms at 19.7MB. Growth is paid only while the cursor sits outside
// the fixed window — in steady state the first window contains it and the cost
// is unchanged — so the bill lands on backlogged sessions and on the first pass
// after a deploy. Raising this constant raises that worst case on both
// synchronous lanes, but only one of them can recover anything for it: the
// sweep folds the whole window through worker.usagesSinceCursor, while the
// prompt-op seam folds through worker.usagesAfterCursor, which falls back to
// the newest entry alone when the cursor is not in the window. A cap hit on
// that lane therefore spends the full growth cost to return exactly what the
// first tailChunkSize window already held.
//
// Reads and parses are not the whole bill. The window also fixes the size of
// the pending batch each caller hands to usage.Sink, and every pending entry
// costs one synchronous Record: usage.LocalSink opens, writes, fsyncs and
// closes per fact (usage.ExecSink spawns a subprocess per fact). A cap-hit
// window on a backlogged session therefore carries orders of magnitude more
// facts than the fixed 64KB tail did, and that per-fact cost dominates the
// read+parse figures above on both synchronous lanes.
//
// Raising it past maxTailTokenBytes (50MB) costs more than latency: it makes
// bufio.ErrTooLong reachable in splitLines, which no caller can trigger
// today, and worker's model-usage sweep classifies every extraction error as
// transient. One permanently oversized transcript line would then leave that
// session unsettled and retried on every controller tick, indefinitely. Keep
// this cap below maxTailTokenBytes.

// ExtractTailUsageSince returns usage-bearing invocations from the tail of a
// transcript, growing the scan window until the entry identified by cursorID
// is inside it — so no invocation is skipped merely because more than
// tailChunkSize bytes were appended since the last extraction.
//
// The fixed-window ExtractTailUsage silently drops any invocation that
// scrolled past the last 64KB between two extractions. The persisted cursor
// (session.MetadataKeyInvocationUsageCursor) is a message identity, not a byte
// offset, so a later pass cannot reach back for what it missed and the usage
// is lost permanently. Growing the window until the cursor is visible closes
// that gap without introducing new persisted state: the caller's existing
// cursor filter still decides what is new.
//
// The window doubles from tailChunkSize until the cursor entry is found, the
// whole file is in the window, or maxUsageScanBytes is reached. Reaching the
// cap bounds that gap rather than closing it: the widest window is returned
// with a nil error, so invocations older than maxUsageScanBytes are lost
// permanently just as the fixed window lost invocations older than
// tailChunkSize. The returned value is indistinguishable from a complete scan,
// so the cap-hit log line is the only signal. An empty
// cursorID (a session with no prior extraction) reads a single tailChunkSize
// window, matching ExtractTailUsage: there is no anchor to reach back to, and
// backfilling a full transcript on first sight is not this function's job.
