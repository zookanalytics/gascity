// C2 defect (ga-6wkhl): a named session never discovered work routed to its own
// claim identity. buildWorkQuery's routed (pool-demand) tier sits behind an
// origin gate that exit-0s for any non-ephemeral GC_SESSION_ORIGIN, so a named
// session (GC_SESSION_ORIGIN=named) short-circuited before probe_pool_demand and
// the frontier bead routed_to=<self>/assignee="" was never a claim candidate.
// The live specimen was olivia: GC_SESSION_ORIGIN=named, GC_ALIAS=olivia,
// poolDemandTarget()=olivia, frontier bead routed_to=olivia. The assigned tier is
// ungated, which is why assignee=olivia work always worked.
//
// The fix widens both origin gates (the plain gate used by the split-tier
// EffectiveRoutedPoolQuery and the graph-anchor-fallback gate used by the
// combined EffectiveWorkQuery) so a non-ephemeral session continues to the
// routed tier when the probe target equals its own claim identity ($1 ==
// GC_ALIAS) and only then. Identity alignment: poolDemandTarget() ($1),
// RoutedToIdentity() (the claim-match primary route target), and GC_ALIAS all
// resolve to the same raw QualifiedName() for a plain named session, so the
// gate-admit identity equals the claim-match identity.

// fakeBDSelfRoutedFrontier returns a fake bd whose only ready work is a single
// unassigned bead routed to route, served to any ready read that probes
// gc.routed_to=route. Every other verb is empty, so the assigned and
// migration/ephemeral tiers all miss — the bead is discoverable ONLY through the
// routed (pool-demand) tier keyed on gc.routed_to=route. That isolates the
// origin gate: if the routed tier never runs, the bead never surfaces.
