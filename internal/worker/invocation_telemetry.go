// recordInvocationTelemetry emits gc.agent.tokens.* and

// completed since the session's persisted invocation-usage cursor
// (session.MetadataKeyInvocationUsageCursor), and — when the handle has a live
// usage sink — emits one model usage.Fact per entry to that sink (the data
// behind gc costs and external aggregators). Both consume the same extracted
// per-invocation usage and the same cursor, so token metrics and model facts
// stay aligned. It is called at
// prompt-operation (message/nudge) finish: prompt submission returns at
// keystroke-delivery time, so the transcript tail at that point holds
// previously COMPLETED invocations — the turn this operation triggers is
// recorded by the next prompt operation on the session. Entries beyond the
// extractor's scan window (a 64KB tail for claude and codex) or after the
// final prompt op of a session go unrecorded.
//
// Coverage is per transcript provider family, driven by the
// invocationUsageSpecs registry, with per-family discovery bounds:
//
//   - claude: Manager.TranscriptPath (session-key stat or ambiguity-guarded
//     project-slug listing — cheap) + the Claude JSONL tail extractor.
//   - codex: identity-first. When the session bead carries a session_key
//     (captured from the codex hook; codex rollout filenames end in the
//     same uuid), the rollout is resolved by that suffix via
//     sessionlog.FindCodexSessionFileByID over the day dirs between bead
//     creation and the wake anchor — this is what keeps telemetry alive for
//     resumed sessions, whose rollout filename timestamp is the FIRST start
//     and predates every later wake. A keyed miss records nothing: a
//     window-found rollout with a different suffix would be misattribution.
//     Without a session_key (fresh start before the hook fires),
//     sessionlog.FindCodexSessionFileNear anchored at the session's
//     last_woke_at metadata (falling back to bead creation time) opens only
//     the rollout day directories intersecting the anchor window. Neither
//     route uses Manager.TranscriptPath, whose codex route walks the full
//     date tree (multi-second scans inside a prompt operation). Un-keyed
//     sessions whose rollout began outside the window (for example
//     crash-adopted sessions whose last_woke_at was cleared, or codex CLIs
//     running under a different local timezone than this process — rollout
//     filenames are local-time and parsed in gc's time.Local) silently
//     record nothing: bounded best-effort by design.
//
// Families without a registered spec are skipped before any discovery —
// their workdir-based fallbacks walk real session stores and no usage
// extractor exists for their transcript formats.
//
// Cost is skipped entirely (not zero-filled) when the pricing registry has
// no entry for the (provider family, model) pair, so missing pricing data is
// never mistaken for free usage. Because a skipped cost leaves no datapoint at
// all, the same beat records gc.agent.invocation.unpriced under the identical
// labels: absence from cost_usd is otherwise indistinguishable from an agent
// that ran for free, and a whole tier of agents can go missing without any
// metric saying so (gc-kawr5). gc.agent.invocation.latency_ms is
// intentionally NOT recorded here: no measured per-invocation latency source
// exists, and the wrapping operation's DurationMs is explicitly excluded by
// RecordInvocationLatency's contract.
//
// Best-effort by design: all errors are swallowed so telemetry never affects
// operations. The persisted cursor (the message identity of the last
// recorded invocation) dedupes across prompt-operation boundaries, but the
// read-record-persist sequence is not atomic: concurrent prompt ops on the
// same session — whether in separate processes or on separate handles in one
// process (the API server constructs a fresh handle per request) — can each
// read the same stale cursor and double-record the pending batch.
// invTelemetryMu only serializes ops that share a single handle instance.
// Accepted as best-effort. RuntimeHandle prompt ops are permanently out of
// scope (decided in ga-tkvb31, not a pending gap): runtime-only sessions
// have no transcript adapter, no session bead for the cursor, and no agent
// identity, and will not gain bead-backed identity just for telemetry.

// sessionlog.FindCodexSessionFileByID(notBefore=awake_started_at,
// notAfter=slept_at||now) — NOT the unbounded date-tree walk — because this runs
// on the SYNCHRONOUS controller reconcile tick, where a full codex-history scan
// per terminal session per tick could stall the tick. FindCodexSessionFileByID
// still resolves resumed sessions whose rollout predates this interval: the
// keyed lookup also scans the session UUID's own creation day (UUIDv7 hint ±2
// days), which is where a resumed rollout was first written.
//
// A codex session with NO captured session_key — the graph.v2 wisp case, where
// no capture path ever ran — falls back to sessionlog.FindCodexSessionFileNear,
// the SAME bounded (cwd, wake-window) lookup the prompt-op seam runs for
// fresh-wake keyless codex (discoverCodexInvocationTranscript). It is anchored at
// the interval START (awake_started_at) with the same fixed
// codexInvocationDiscoveryWindow, NOT the interval span: a rollout's filename
// timestamp is the codex START (≈ the interval start), not its end, so a small
// forward window catches a fresh wisp's rollout while keeping the scan to ~one day
// directory — the interval span could be days for a long-awake session or a stale
// slept_at, re-opening the unbounded-scan risk this bound exists to prevent. Wisps
// run in per-wisp worktrees, so the session_meta cwd disambiguates on its own;
// FindCodexSessionFileNear still REFUSES ambiguity (more than one in-window rollout
// under the same cwd yields "") so a reused workdir records nothing rather than
// misattributing.

// The returned scanClean is meaningful only for the keyless-codex fallback: it is
// false when the (cwd, wake-window) scan hit a transient IO fault (a non-ENOENT
// readdir or a cwd-probe open failure — EMFILE/ESTALE). That clouds BOTH an empty
// path (a miss that may have hidden the only rollout) AND a lone hit (a fault may
// have hidden a second same-cwd rollout, making the singleton non-definitive), so
// the caller retries rather than recording or settling either. The keyed codex
// lookup and the claude manager lookup return scanClean true, which the caller
