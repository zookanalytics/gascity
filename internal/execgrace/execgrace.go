// Package execgrace provides cooperative cancellation and optional
// activity-aware timeouts for [os/exec.Cmd].
//
// It generalizes two patterns that already exist piecemeal in the codebase:
//
//   - Graceful cancellation ([Apply]): the command runs in its own process
//     group and context cancellation interrupts that group first, so shell
//     rollback traps (and any foreground child blocking them) get a chance to
//     run before cancellation escalates to a forced kill. Without this, Go's
//     default [os/exec.CommandContext] cancel is Process.Kill — SIGKILL — which
//     is untrappable: a setup script killed mid-flight can never restore state
//     it staged aside (the worktree-setup data-loss class). This is the same
//     protection [internal/runtime/exec]'s interruptThenKill introduced for
//     adapter scripts, lifted to a reusable home.
//
//   - Activity-aware deadlines ([Monitor]): a fixed wall-clock timeout cannot
//     distinguish a hung command from a slow-but-healthy one. A Monitor cancels
//     its context only after the command has produced no output for a
//     configurable idle window, with an independent absolute ceiling as the
//     runaway backstop (a command that streams output forever must still die).
//     Both dimensions are opt-in: a zero idle and zero ceiling yield a Monitor
//     that passes the parent context and writers through untouched, so call
//     sites keep their existing fixed-deadline behavior unless they ask for
//     more.

// Apply configures cmd for cooperative cancellation and returns the flag that
// records whether a cancellation action was delivered.
//
// It places the command in its own process group (POSIX; no-op on Windows),
// replaces the default context-cancel behavior (SIGKILL) with
// [InterruptThenKill], and raises cmd.WaitDelay to grace when grace is larger
// than the current value. WaitDelay bounds how long Wait allows the
// interrupted process — its rollback traps included — and any grandchildren
// holding the I/O pipes before Go forcibly terminates them, so grace is
// effectively the trap budget. A zero grace leaves WaitDelay untouched.
//
// The returned flag serves callers that need cancellation to win over the
// command's own exit status (see [internal/runtime/exec]); callers that only
// need the graceful signal ordering may ignore it.

// InterruptThenKill builds an [os/exec.Cmd.Cancel] that first interrupts the
// command's process group so a cooperative command — and any foreground child
// blocking its rollback trap — can roll back before cancellation becomes a
// forced kill, recording in accepted whether cancellation was delivered so the
// caller can let it win over the command's own exit status. Platforms without
// process groups or os.Interrupt (such as Windows) fall back to Kill.
//
// A single group interrupt can miss a foreground child that was mid-fork/exec
// when it was delivered, leaving the shell blocked in wait with its trap
// deferred until WaitDelay force-kills it. On a successful group interrupt the
// Cancel spawns a ladder (reinterruptForegroundChildren) that re-interrupts the
// surviving child until it exits or the grace budget elapses, so the trap runs.
// The foreground children are snapshotted before the interrupt — while the
// shell is still blocked in them, before its trap can start — so the ladder
// never re-signals a process the trap later spawns.
