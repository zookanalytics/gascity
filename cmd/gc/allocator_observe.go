// The allocator's reading of the observation cache (I3) per census row, under
// amendment AM3 (P3 spec §4.4 step 10). The inventory lane publishes listing,
// liveness and incarnation for every backend, and attach only for backends
// with a batched inventory; it never publishes pending or activity (F1). So:
//
//   - an unsupported fact is No, never a reason to keep a session;
//   - pending is an input only as a fresh Yes a session key wrote through
//     Note, and only for a row whose runtime is alive; the session key's fresh
//     check before a drain is the fence;
//   - only unknown liveness, and a stale or unprimed attach on a backend that
//     reports attach, make a row uncertain.
//
// Facts are attributed by bead ID: a runtime name that several open rows
// share (enterprise slot-scoped names, F8) is alive for its owner row only,
// and occupied for the others.
