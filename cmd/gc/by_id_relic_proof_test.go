//
// beads.OpenSQLiteStore creates the database when it is absent — that is why
// infraBindingHoldsNothing checks infraPathExists before it opens, and says so
// in as many words: "a probe that creates the database it is asked about would
// be answering its own question". The most common refused city is the
// NEVER-MIGRATED one, whose binding database does not exist at all, and on that
// city an ordinary by-id read reaches this proof. Creating a binding root as
// the side effect of a READ is the one thing this path must not do — on the
// built-in engine it leaves an empty database that a later boot reads as a
// genesis root, and on a workspace-backed provider it would start a managed
// engine.
