// A named, interactive-resume, assigned-work-only session must never be
// selected as an idle-probe target: beginIdleRespawnDrainIfIdle refuses to
// drain named sessions (they're materialized by the named-session loop, not
// pool respawn), so a probe started on one is never consumed by any clear
// site and permanently blocks all future probes for that session ID via the
// dt.idleProbes[id] != nil guard. This drives two ticks to prove the
// exclusion is steady, not a first-tick coincidence.
