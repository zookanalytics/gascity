// The boot census, and the probe it is allowed to retire.
//
// C4 made the mint bit an observation and left the relic bit pessimistically
// true, so nothing retired. This is the commit where a plan shape actually
// changes, and these rows are the live pair the change is worth: a clean
// binding stops probing, and a binding holding one migrated bead does not.
//
// Both rows run against a REAL sqlite binding opened by openStorageRoutes,
// because the claim is about what a converged city's boot observes, and a
// hand-built topology could assert the bits without ever proving the boot sets
// them.
