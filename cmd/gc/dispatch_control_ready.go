// This file cuts the gc->bd read-storm documented on ga-ak6rt1: the
// control-dispatcher's per-tick readiness scan (workflowServeControlReadyQueryForBeads,
// dispatch_runtime.go) builds a shell script that fork-execs up to ~9
// bd/jq processes per agent per tick. Wire that same readiness evaluation to
// answer from an in-process CachingStore snapshot first, falling back to
// exactly one batched `bd ready --json` call when the snapshot can't answer,
// instead of the shell script's N separate `bd` invocations.
//
// Why this hooks into nextWorkflowServeBeads (the default workflowServeList
// implementation) rather than drainWorkflowServeWork: workflowServeList is a
// package var every existing serve-loop test overrides wholesale to fake the
// ready queue, so changing drainWorkflowServeWork's call site to bypass it
// for control-dispatcher agents would silently stop exercising ~25 existing
// tests' fakes. nextWorkflowServeBeads is never called directly by any
// existing test (they all replace workflowServeList outright), so extending
// its body here is additive: the exact query-string shape from
// workflowServeControlReadyQueryForBeads is unchanged (still asserted upon by
// TestWorkflowServeControlReadyQuery* tests), and any non-control-ready query
// -- or any failure standing up the cache -- falls straight through to the
// original shell exec, unchanged.

// controlReadyQueryMarkerPrefix identifies a workQuery produced by
// workflowServeControlReadyQueryForBeads. That function always writes this
// exact literal prefix (BD_EXPORT_AUTO=false plus a non-empty
// GC_CONTROL_TARGET, dispatch_runtime.go:788); no other work_query shape
// produces it.

// controlReadyFallbackLimit bounds the single batched bd ready call issued
// when the cache can't answer. It must be generous enough that per-candidate/
// per-route filtering in Go (each capped at workflowServeScanLimit) is never
// starved by an earlier truncation at the bd layer -- unlike the shell script
// this replaces (which ran each candidate/route's own independently-capped bd
// call), this single batched call's cap is shared across every candidate and
// route, so it must hold a whole city's ready set even during the write
// bursts that make the cache dirty in the first place. It costs one bd call
