// TestBeadCopyDifferenceWitnessesEveryDurableField guards against the struct, so
// a field added to beads.Bead is either compared by beadCopyDifference or listed
// here — never silently unwitnessed.
//
// The reasons matter as much as the names. An exemption is normally a promise that
// a copy which changed this field is still a faithful copy, and two of these five
// are only true because something else witnesses the same state.
// IndefinitelyDeferred is the one exemption that does not carry that promise: the
// destination cannot hold it, so the deferral genuinely does not cross. It is
// exempt because comparing it would refuse every copy of a deferred infra row
// without preserving anything — not because the copy stays faithful. Do not cite
// it as precedent for exempting a field the destination could hold.
