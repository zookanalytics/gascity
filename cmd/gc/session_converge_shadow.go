// S19 Stage 3 shadow-comparison harness (steps 3a–3c, OBSERVATION-ONLY).
//
// This file proves that deriveConvergeActions (Stage 1) reproduces the legacy
// per-path reconciler behavior EXACTLY, without changing any behavior. Nothing
// here executes an action, double-writes, or mutates a session bead. It only:
//
//   3a — builds per-session {durableFacts, runtimeFacts} from ALREADY-observed
//        reconciler state (no new probes, no writes);
//   3b — records legacy writes of the compared metadata keys through an
//        in-process synchronous recorder, snapshots those keys at tick start and
//        tick end (the owned-key state-diff oracle), and judges derived-vs-legacy
//        through a bounded-window replay comparator;
//   3c — increments denominator + divergence counters (no new event type), and
//        is validated by a write-site-completeness guard and a seeded-mutation
//        canary (both in *_test.go).
//
// The flip (3d double-write), the flag/kill-switch substrate (3e), and real-city
// priming coverage are explicitly NOT in this file — they are later, separately
// gated stages. The harness itself sits behind its own enable latch
// (convergeShadowEnabled), fail-closed to OFF, so a controller that never opts in
// is byte-for-byte identical to the pre-Stage-3 controller.

// convergeComparedKeys are the durable metadata keys the shadow harness compares
