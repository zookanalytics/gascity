// This file is the split-store conformance suite: one set of ownership
// invariants, each run over BOTH store topologies through the splitEnv fixture
// (split_topology_env_test.go).
//
// Every invariant guards a bug class that has fired at least once, and every one
// of those bugs had the same root cause: a call site answering "which store owns
// this class of bead?" differently from the canonical dispatch,
// resolveClassStore (class_store.go). Two of them reached production and are
// named on the invariants that pin them — order-tracking beads born in the work
// store on a split city (#5127), and readers left on the work ledger for
// relocated ids (#5125).
//
// Each invariant is a named subtest. Each routes through forEachTopology or
// forEachTopologyWithRig, so the split subtest catches a path that hard-codes
// one store and the single-store subtest catches a split-city fix that changed
// legacy behavior. scripts/check-split-topology-rows.sh enforces that shape
// statically: an invariant that minted its own single-topology env would cover
// one row and let a regression in the other sail through.
//
// # Invariants that state a gap instead of asserting one
//
// Some invariants name a capability main does not have yet. Those SKIP with the
// reason and the seam that is missing, rather than being quietly omitted or
// asserted against a seam that does not exist. The skip list is this program's
// verified remaining work, and it is currently EMPTY: I5's claim-mutation half
// was the last entry, and it closed when the shared by-id class resolver landed
// (storeref.ClassCandidates, ga-ia7li). A new gap gets a skip, not a deletion.
//
// Others pin behavior main HAS but should not keep. Those carry a KNOWN GAP
// paragraph naming the divergence, the assertions that move when it closes, and
// the slice that closes it. Leaving such a leg UNSEEDED is the failure mode this
// convention exists to prevent: the invariant then reads as coverage of a path
// it never touches.
//
// The list, current as of the residency resolver's S2 slice:
//
//   - OPEN — I1 and I2: the HQ work store is in neither arm of the controller's
//     cross-store scan on a split city. That is the census/demand side, and S3
//     closes it (the D6 flip: the binding becomes a leg BESIDE the city work
//     store instead of replacing it).
//   - CLOSED by S2 — I5's release-tier gap. Crash recovery, the retired-session
//     sweep, `gc session close` and drain-ack all resolve the same leg set from
//     the city's routes (assignedWorkSweepPlan), so a class-routed claim is
//     released by the same pass that releases a work-store one. What remains
//     open there is ga-zp3uj, named in I5's own text: the AGENT-SIDE recovery
//     tiers are raw bd commands in a work directory and stay topology-blind.
//   - CLOSED — I10's wake-filter gap (ga-whzrt, #5250) and its ownership-index
//     half (ga-j4ob9, S2). Both mechanisms now resolve their refs from the
//     city's residency topology, and I10 asserts they agree.
//
// # Which authority an invariant is pinning
//
// Some assertions are about a production backend (bd/Dolt, SQLite), some are
// about the splittest kit's deliberate domain rules, and some are about cmd/gc's
// own wrappers. They do not agree, so an invariant states which one it pins —
// see I6, where the cross-prefix dep refusal is the KIT's co-residence rule and
// neither backend refuses the write, and I5, where the negative is stated
// against the class store's namespace rather than against a wrapper's
// capability opacity.

// conformanceReadyFederation (I1) guards the "no work" fail-open: a worker
// spawns, the demand read cannot see the work it was spawned for, and the
// session drains. The controller's cross-store demand scan
// (collectOpenUnassignedRoutedWork, the input to openControlDispatcherDemand and
// the pool spawn decision) is handed the SESSIONS-class store as its leading
// leg, exactly as CityRuntime.buildDesiredState wires it. On a split city that
// leg is the class store — which is also where routed graph-class work lives,
// because the whole split shares one binding — so an open routed bead in the
// durable control shape AND in the wisp shape must both surface there, with the
// rig store's own routed work alongside it. A leading store resolved to the WORK
// class instead would read zero and drain the fleet.
//
// THE TWO LEG SETS AGREE, and that is what this row now pins. The CLAIM read's
// legs are enumerated in ready_federation.go's contract header: city work store,
// then rigs by name ascending, then the relocated binding LAST. The DEMAND
// read's legs are the same set, because both are now Plan(RoutedWork)/
// Plan(Census) over one topology (S3) rather than two hand-maintained lists.
//
// The HQ WORK store was the last leg-set divergence, and it is closed here. The
// scan used to take the store it was HANDED as its city leg — the sessions-class
// store, which on a converged split IS the binding — while the rig arm is
// rigBeadStores(), which deletes the city entry. So the HQ work store was in
// NEITHER arm and a city-scope routed WORK bead was invisible to controller-tick
// demand: the "no work" fail-open this invariant is named for (D6, ga-88mxz).
// Now the work store and the binding are DISTINCT ref'd legs.
//
// # The PLANE split, and why the split row's answer changed (tick-S3, ga-l7jdg)
//
// The demand read is now Plan(RoutedWork) narrowed to the RUNTIME plane. On a
// split city that is the binding alone, because the operator ruling is that
// routed work lives only in the graph store — "gc ready work will never be in
// the work db" (ga-4qdfn) — and reading the remote work ledger on the tick is a
// misrouting bug by definition, not a cost to amortize (bd memory
// gascity-runtime-infra-store-invariant). It was 8.1s of a 24.2s demand leg.
//
// So this row asserts the plane, not a single answer: on a LEGACY city every
// routed bead is still found (the work store IS the infra store there, and the
// D6 assertion is unchanged), while on a SPLIT city the work-leg rows are
// deliberately absent and the invariant they used to carry moves to two other
// places, both asserted below:
//
//   - the rows that ARE demandable must still be complete and correctly
//     attributed — the same fail-open, restated for the plane; and
//   - a routed bead left on a work leg must not vanish silently. The
//     route-recovery convergence lane reads every leg on its own cadence and
//     counts them as off_plane_routed, loudly, with `gc storage migrate` as the
//     named remedy (route_recovery_lane.go). "No reader sees it" would be D6
//     again; "the tick does not, and the hourly lane says so" is the plane.

// conformanceClaimRouting (I5) is the by-id ROUTING invariant: given only a bead
// id, the program must be able to name the store that owns it — and must name
// the same one for the ordinary class id shape and for the <prefix>-wisp-<suffix>
// shape a wisp carries.
//
// storeref.PrefixOwner is that routing primitive (internal/dispatch,
// internal/convoy and cmd/gc/cmd_wait already route on it), and it resolves on
// the store's own declared namespace: the prefix+"-" SEGMENT rule. Its sibling
// predicate storeref.IDInNamespace — the CONFIGURED-prefix rule the shared class
// resolver gates on — is deliberately not the same rule, because a configured
// rig/HQ prefix can be a whole id while a store that mints "gcg-1" never mints
// the bare "gcg". They agree on every id shape this invariant routes and diverge
// on the bare form, so nothing here may be read as one implying the other.
// This invariant pins that both shapes route to the class store on a split
// city, and pins the TRAP that makes the wisp shape special: the config-free
// sling.BeadPrefix heuristic answers "gcg-wisp" for a gcg-wisp-0042 id, which is
// not a reserved class prefix at all, so a by-id router built on that heuristic
// instead of the namespace rule would hand every wisp to the work store. That
// divergence is asserted as a negative here so it cannot change silently under a
// future resolver.
//
// The CLAIM-MUTATION half runs on the SHARED resolver, storeref.ClassCandidates
// (ga-ia7li), which is the seam this invariant was waiting on: a candidate list
// keyed on the resolveClassStore identity, probed in order, with the mutation
// written through the store that answered. splitEnv.claimByID is that shape, and
// the assertion is residence — the claim is visible in the owning store and in
// no other leg.
//
// GAP CLOSED in ga-601v2 — `gc hook --claim` is class-routed, and NOT by the
// shape the pin predicted. The prediction is kept here because the shape it got
// wrong is the interesting part.
//
// What was pinned: the hook resolves its stores as hookStore{dir, env} pairs
// (hook_cross_store.go) and execs bd in a work directory; the fan-out is city +
// rigs, all WORK scopes, so a claim it issued for a relocated class id ran
// against a ledger that could not see the bead. The rows below asserted that
// fan-out on both topologies and were expected to REDDEN when the closure added
// a coordination-class leg to it.
//
// They did not, and could not: a relocated binding is not a bd workspace and
// cannot be expressed as a hookStore{dir, env} at all — the same sentence the
// pin used to explain why the gap existed also rules out the closure it
// predicted. Both halves landed beside the fan-out instead of inside it:
//
//   - The READ half (ga-bvdha): no leg was added. The primary leg's COMMAND was
//     swapped to the federated `gc ready`, which covers the binding in process.
//   - The WRITE half (ga-601v2, claim_class_route.go): no leg was added. The
//     CLASS axis went on the hookClaimOps seam, beside the rig axis already in
//     claim_cross_store.go, so the claim-time writes escalate off the work store
//     to the binding for a bead the work store proves it does not hold.
//
// So the fan-out rows below are no longer a gap statement. They are the
// invariant that keeps the two halves apart: every leg the hook QUERIES stays a
// bd workspace naming a work scope, and a coordination-class leg appearing there
// now means someone has tried to express a binding as a workspace. The rows that
// state the closure are the routed-claim ones after them, and they are asserted
// against the production seams (hookClaimClassRouteForCity, the resolver, and
// classRoutedHookClaimOps, the ops wrapper) rather than against claimByID.
//
// PROBE, NOT PREFIX, AND WORK FIRST. The claim is a WRITE, so it finds its store
// by asking which one holds the bead — `gc storage migrate` preserves ids, so a
// prefix route would miss exactly the beads that moved. The probe ORDER is the
// part that differs from the by-id door, and it is deliberate: the by-id
// resolvers lead with the class store, while the federated `gc ready` that
// SERVED this claim its candidate leads with the work store and runs the graph
// leg last (#5148/#5158/#5161). A claim must resolve co-residence the way the
// reader that produced it does, or it claims the class copy while the reader
// keeps answering from the still-open work copy — the treadmill this closure
// exists to end. The rows below assert that: a class-resident id routes to the
// binding, a co-resident id keeps the WORK copy.
//
// `gc bd update --claim` is also routed (#5132, cmd_bd_by_id.go) and probes the
// same way but in the opposite ORDER, because its caller holds only an id and no
// reader to agree with. That divergence is real and is asserted below rather

// at all, so a dead session's binding-resident claim had no automatic reopen
// lane. The rows below are unchanged in what they assert; only the mechanism
// that puts the binding in the scan moved.
//
// What is NOT closed here, and is ga-zp3uj: the agent-side recovery tiers

//     co-residence rule (convoy.TrackItemIn's ErrMemberNotCoResident), which a
//     BdSemantics leaf enforces on purpose and says so in its own wording. So
//     this row pins the domain invariant, NOT a backend behavior, and the fail-
//     open it names is LIVE in production: on a real split city the dangling
//     edge lands, the dependent silently drops out of Ready, and the parent goes
//     READY mid-DAG. Closing that is a later slice (ga-ia7li's by-id resolver is
//     what a co-residence preflight would be built on); until then the honest
//     statement is that the kit refuses what production performs.
//   - SAME-PREFIX unresolvable endpoint through the WORK front door: this one bd
//     genuinely hard-fails, in its own wording ("resolving issue ID %s: no issue
//     found matching %q"), because a same-prefix id gets no external-ref
//     pass-through. Asserted on BOTH topologies, so the suite exercises bd's
//     real rejection and not only the kit's domain rule.
//   - CROSS-PREFIX endpoint through the CLASS front door (SQLite): ACCEPTED and
//     recorded as a residence violation, because the deps table has no foreign

// bead came out of; both resolve from cfg plus the holder's own identities, so a
// legacy city and a split city cannot diverge.
//
// The two mechanisms now answer the SAME question, which is the S2 flip this
// row's own note asked for ("if you widen the ownership index, update its
// assertion here and re-check that both sub-topologies still agree").
//
//   - The WAKE filter keeps a claim on the LEADING arm when the assignee is one
//     of the holder's own exact identities, whatever the holder's rig scope.
//     That arm is the relocated class binding on a split city — where claim-time
//     class routing writes the assignee — and the city store on a legacy one,
//     which a rig-scoped agent's hook fan-out reaches anyway
//     (appendCityHookStore). Dropping the claim left a live holder with
//     AwakeDecision{Reason:""} and the no-wake-reason drain recycled it mid-step
//     (ga-whzrt).
//   - The ownership INDEX now grants the same arm to the same identities. It had
//     to move WITH the release path's own widening, not after it: the
//     orphan-release scan reads the binding as a leg now, so an index that still
//     answered "this holder owns only its rig" would let the scan reap a LIVE
//     worker's binding-resident claim. A missed wake costs a cycle; a false
//     release is claim loss (ga-j4ob9).
//
// Both sub-topologies answer identically, which is the conformance property:
// neither mechanism reads which physical store a bead came out of, and the refs
// they compare come from the city's own residency topology.

// merged the two answers as if they were the same question.
//
// win-mc-forge measured it, and the arithmetic is exact: against the relocated

// beads, three of them wisps; the federated reader over the same store returned
// exactly the other 14, while still serving the work stores' own ephemeral rows.
// No leg errored. No flag was rejected. The wisps were simply not there — and

// reads as having no runnable frontier and is diagnosed as stalled when it is
// fine.

// I13's oracle is the OTHER surface, and both surfaces had the same hole: the

//
// Two projections, the same molecule, the same command, opposite semantics.
// `dep tree` names the bead in an id POSITION so the by-id door decides
// ownership and takes it; --metadata-field is not id-valued, so that door
// correctly declines (a QUOTED id decides nothing about ownership — see
// cmd_bd_by_id.go) and the passthrough asks the one ledger that holds no gcg-
// row, which answers `[]` and exits 0. The value named an id; the VERB is a
// projection. Invariant 0 of ga-iaj7k: a projection that cannot see a class must
// fail LOUDLY, and `[]` is forbidden.
//
// What the by-id door DOES with `dep tree` changed under ga-pxppl — it used to
// refuse, and now it walks the molecule from the binding the class is served
// from — and that does not weaken this invariant, it strengthens it. The claim
// was never "both refuse". It is that neither answers `[]` from a ledger that
// cannot hold the bead: on a split city all three argvs divert away from that
// ledger, `dep tree` to an ANSWER and `list`/`ready` to a REFUSAL that names the
// federated reader.
//
// The asymmetry is what makes it urgent rather than merely wrong. An operator
// who has learned that this CLI refuses what it cannot see reads the empty array
// as a fact about the molecule.
//
// # What this asserts, and why on the argv predicates
//
// The two fates are decided before any store is touched, by two pure functions
// of (config, argv): bdSQLRelocatedClassRefusal for `list` and
// bdArgsNameClassOwnedBead for every other verb. So the coherence claim is
// checkable exactly where it is decided, and the row runs on both topologies
// without opening a binding. The end-to-end proofs through the real command —
// real doBd, a bd stub that answers `[]` and exits 0 — are
// TestGcBdProjectionsAgreeOnAClassTheyCannotSee for the refusing verbs and
// TestGcBdDepTreeSplitsOnOwnershipNotOnServability for the answering one.
//
// # The single-store row is the byte-identity claim
//
// It is not a formality and it is not hardcoded: the fixture mints work-prefixed
// ids on that topology, so the SAME two argvs carry no reserved prefix, name no
// relocated class, and both projections pass through to bd exactly as a legacy
// city always ran them. A guard that started refusing there would fail here
// first.
//
// # A refusal has to be actionable, and honest about how far it goes
//
// Loud is necessary and not sufficient: refusing a question nothing can answer
// just moves the dead end. So the last legs assert the way OUT that the refusal
// names — the federated `gc ready` reader — returns the molecule's members on
// BOTH topologies, from the store that owns them.
//
// They also assert its LIMIT, on a molecule that is not all open, because the
// modal case is a stuck one: a molecule with no claimable step is exactly the
// molecule an operator lists, and the escape's default spelling returns []
// there. The refusal text states that (one status per invocation, no --all, no
// deferred) and this row is what keeps the statement true — a fixture where
// every step is open would let the steering silently become wrong again.
//
// # The verbs move together
//
// `ready` is asserted alongside `list` because they take the SAME selector and

//
//  1. The seam answers. cityQueryTopology is the production resolver, and it
//     rides on graphClassBinding — the same question resolveClassStore asks —
//     so a city that relocates nothing federates nothing.
//  2. The command changes, and only in the reader. The single-store row is the
//     byte-identity claim (its exact bytes are pinned by
//     internal/config's TestWorkQueryGolden); here it is the command WORD that
//     matters, because a split city emitting `bd ready` is the blindness.
//  3. The reader the command names actually answers with the routed graph work,
//     read through the production leg assembly rather than a restatement of it.
//
// GAP CLOSED in ga-601v2 — SEE AND CLAIM. This invariant makes graph-class work
// VISIBLE to the worker's query. What it used to pin, one paragraph down, was
// that the same command could not then CLAIM it: `gc hook --claim` ran its claim
// against a bd store rooted in the agent's work directory
// (hookClaimBdStoreContext over hookQueryEnv, the WORK scope I5 pins), which
// cannot reach the relocated class at all.
//
// The claim-time writes are now class-routed (claim_class_route.go). The work
// store is still the store the claim RUNS AGAINST first — that is the tie-break,
// and it has to be, because this query's own reader dedupes a co-resident id to
// the work row — and the binding is reached only where that work-scope write
// returns the not-found that PROVES the bead is not there
// (hookClaimBeadIsElsewhere, unwidened). So the two halves of the split-city
// worker now agree: the bead this query surfaces is one the same command claims.
//
// The rows below assert both halves, because both still have to hold:
//
//  1. The WORK store still cannot resolve a relocated bead, and still fails with
//     the not-found the claim path classifies as "it lives elsewhere". That is
//     the fixture's residence fact AND the escalation signal — if it stopped
//     being ErrNotFound, the routing would never fire and the claim would fail
//     closed instead.
//  2. The claim escalates past it and lands in the binding.
//  3. The fail-soft behavior SURVIVES. An id NEITHER store holds is still
