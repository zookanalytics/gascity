roots, step beads and control beads live.

It is the in-process, city-wide drop-in for the single-store "bd ready" work
query, so workers and the control plane see graph-class work instead of an
authoritative-looking short answer. On a city that relocates no coordination
class it reads the one store, unchanged.

The flags mirror the "bd ready" contract the default work_query builds:
  gc ready --metadata-field "gc.routed_to=$target" --unassigned \
           --exclude-type=epic --exclude-label "hold:mayor" \
           --sort oldest --limit 0 --json

Rows are emitted in canonical ready order (priority, created_at, id) unless
--sort selects a created_at order, and --limit is applied last, so a bounded
read is the true top-N of the merged set rather than the top-N of whichever
store answered first.
