// The storage-class migration: how a city's infrastructure classes move out of
// the work store and into a binding of their own.
//
// A city whose [storage.classes] point graph/sessions/messaging/orders/nudges
// at a non-work binding, while work stays on the reserved `work` binding, still
// holds every one of those beads in the work store until this runs. It copies
// that slice into the binding's bead engine — ids preserved, within-class dep
// topology re-added — then TESTS EQUALITY between source and destination, and
// only then records convergence.
//
// # Destination
//
// The copy lands in the exact database the deployed provider opens, under the
// exact id prefix it opens it with: the provider's own resolver supplies
// <binding root>/graph/beads.sqlite, and config.ReservedClassPrefix supplies
// the reserved namespace it mints in. Neither is spelled here. A migration that
// writes its own idea of the path reports success into a file no runtime
// binding ever opens, which is a worse failure than not running at all — so the
// path and the prefix come from the provider's helper and the shared prefix
// registry rather than from a local join, and they cannot drift apart from what
// the runtime reads.
//
// # Trigger and ordering
//
// The migration is triggered BY the config swap, not the other way around: it
// resolves its destination from [storage.classes] and [storage.bindings], so by
// the time it runs the operator has already pointed the infrastructure classes
// at the binding. The real order is
//
//	operator swaps [storage.classes] → operator runs the command → equality → marker
//
// and not the copy → verify → swap shape a migration usually has. Nothing here
// can own the swap: it observes only post-swap config, so there is no pre-swap
// state left to swap from; gc does not author city.toml; and a process that
// rewrote the operator's storage assignments would be racing config reload for
// ownership of the same file. What this can own — and does — is refusing to
// record convergence for a copy it could not prove.
//
// The consequence is an operator-visible window: between the swap and a proven
// copy, the city is configured to read a binding that does not yet hold its
// infrastructure state. A boot inside that window refuses to start and names
// the command, so no read is ever served from the wrong side of it.
//
// # Boot never migrates
//
// This file performs the move only from the operator command. Boot calls the
// check half — target resolution, convergence read, per-boot containment
// re-check, genesis — and maps what it finds to a verdict; storage_boot.go
// turns a non-serving verdict into a refusal to start.
//
// That split is the whole point. A boot that migrated unattended served
// infrastructure reads AND writes from a binding nothing had proven held the
// city's state, and the first such write made the binding non-empty, which made
// any later revert lossy and left an unstamped row that prepareInfraDestination
// would refuse on every subsequent boot. Detection cannot have that side
// effect, so the copy is not on the boot path at all.
//
// # How the revert instruction is licensed
//
// Pointing [storage.classes] back at "work" is correct on a city that never cut
// over and destructive on one that did.
//
// So the instruction is NOT derived from what a check concluded. Outcomes are
// reachable through many chains — a failed copy, a failed equality check, a
// manifest that would not rename, a marker that would not rename after a copy
// that fully succeeded — and each new chain into an outcome that names the
// revert is a new way to print a destructive instruction. Three rounds of that
// found three chains.
//
// It is derived instead from POSITIVE EVIDENCE about the binding, read after
// the fact by infraBindingHoldsNothing: a binding root this process could
// actually enumerate, holding no marker, no manifest, and a database that
// either does not exist or enumerates empty. That is the condition under which
// reverting can lose nothing, stated as a property of the binding rather than
// of any path. infraMigrationOperatorAdvice appends the revert on that evidence
// alone, so an outcome can suppress the sentence and can never grant it, and a
// chain that has not been thought of yet cannot reach it at all.
//
// The root read is the load-bearing one, and it is what the fourth round of
// this hazard turned on. The other three facts are all absences, and an absence
// only means "nothing is there" when the directory that would hold it was seen.
// A binding root that vanishes wholesale — an unmounted volume taking the
// marker, the manifest and the database with it — makes all three absences read
// true at once, which is how a converged city was offered an instruction that
// would abandon everything on that volume. Absence of everything is not proof
// of emptiness; it is usually proof that nobody looked.
//
// # The source after the marker
//
// Nothing in the work store changes before the marker, so a rollback before
// cutover is a config swap with no data recovery step. That is the whole reason
// equality is a separate, fail-closed stage rather than a side effect of the
// copy.
//
// Past the marker the binding is the only authoritative copy, and the work
// store's rows are cleared (infra_class_clear.go): backed up beside the
// manifest, the backup re-read and proven, and only then removed. Keeping them
// — which this migration did until gc 1.5.1 — left every relocated bead living
// twice under one id, and every reader that reaches the work store first was
// served the frozen copy (#5987).
//
// # Writers, and the stranded-write window
//
// A copy is only as good as the source holding still. Two mechanisms bound
// that, and neither is a byte-lock over the source, because nothing here can
// take one: the source is a store any `bd` or `gc` process can open, so "no
// writer exists" is not a decidable question from inside this file.
//
// The first mechanism is exclusion of the one writer that IS provable. A
// controller serves .gc/controller.sock for its whole life, so a live one
// answers a ping with its PID. infraMigrationForeignControllerPID asks, and a
// foreign answer is a refusal — the copy does not run against a source another
// controller is still writing.
//
// The second mechanism is detection, because the first cannot be complete.
// Any other process — `gc sling`, a mail write, a rig-side `bd` — can add an
// infrastructure bead to the work store without holding anything this migration
// can see. verifyInfraCopy's re-read turns a write landing DURING the copy into
// a refusal, but a write landing between that re-read and the marker rename is
// stranded in the retained source, and the marker would otherwise bless the
// binding as converged and make it invisible forever. So convergence is not
// re-asserted from the marker alone: confirmInfraConvergence re-checks, on
// every later boot, that every infrastructure bead the source still holds is
// readable from the binding. A strand does not become silent — it becomes a
// blocked boot naming the ids, and the beads are still intact in the retained
// source.
//
// The window is therefore not narrowed, which would only make the loss rarer.
// It is closed for the writer that can be excluded, and made loud for the
// writers that cannot.
//
// # What absence from the binding actually means
//
// "The source holds it and the binding does not" is not by itself a strand,
// and reading it as one would defeat the detector. The binding is the live
// infrastructure store after cutover, and its own lifecycle DELETES rows: wisp
// GC hard-deletes the ownership closure of every expired closed workflow root,
// and the mail retention sweep hard-deletes read message wisps. A work store
// that has not been cleared yet (a city migrated by a build that kept its
// source) still holds those rows. So the first wisp GC after cutover leaves
// such a source holding beads the binding will never hold again — an entirely
// correct divergence, which the clear removes. A
// check that called that a strand would fire on every healthy city, and an
// alarm that fires on every healthy city is muted, which is how the real strand
// it exists to catch goes unseen.
//
// The distinction the check needs is "the binding never received this bead"
// versus "the binding received it and its own lifecycle removed it". Neither
// the binding nor the source carries that after the fact — a deleted row leaves
// nothing behind, the provenance stamp goes with it, and the copy's own row is
// gone — so the migration RECORDS it: writeInfraCopyManifest writes the exact
// id set the equality stage proved, beside the marker and before it. Later
// boots read the manifest rather than infer.
//
// Recorded evidence rather than a timestamp cut, deliberately. A creation-time
// cut looks equivalent and is not: the work store truncates CreatedAt to second
// granularity, because its backend persists timestamps at second granularity.
// Cutting on a time therefore cannot separate a bead written just before the
// proof from one written just after, and both misreadings are harmful — one
// invents a strand on a healthy city, the other drops the exact write this
// check exists to name.
//
// # What this cannot see, stated rather than papered over
//
// One residue survives, and it is bounded rather than reported as a strand: a
// bead the copy DID deliver and the binding has since lost to something other
// than its own GC — a wipe, a bad restore, a store bug — is indistinguishable
// from a legitimate GC delete, because both leave the same evidence, which is
// none. Those are counted, not named, and surfaced only as context alongside a
// real strand. Separating them would need the binding to keep tombstones for
// rows its GC deletes, which it does not and should not.
//
// A city converged before the manifest existed has a marker and no manifest.
// That city gets no strand detection — there is nothing to check against — and
// says so rather than pretending either answer.
//
// # Cannot check is not did not converge
//
// Every read this check makes can fail on a perfectly healthy city: a busy
// database, a momentary permission fault, a manifest on a filesystem that
// hiccuped. None of those is evidence about the city. A failed re-check
// therefore reports infraMigrationUncheckable rather than non-convergence, and
// the boot refusal names the failed read instead of claiming the city never
// converged.
//
// What licenses that distinction is the marker. It is durable evidence that a
// copy completed and an equality stage passed, and a store that will not open
// right now does not retract it. Absence of proof is not proof of absence.
//
// This distinction is worth keeping for the diagnosis it gives an operator, but
// it is no longer load-bearing for their data: the revert is licensed by the
// binding's contents, not by which of these two an outcome landed on.
//
// # Genesis cities
//
// A genesis city never migrates, and two independent gates keep it dark. A city
// born on its own infrastructure store — one on an out-of-tree provider, or any
// city with no [storage] at all — does not resolve a migration target and this
// opens nothing. A city whose destination already holds rows this migration did
// not stamp is refused at the destination gate rather than overwritten.
//
// "No [storage] at all" means never configured, not un-configured: a city that
// HAS served a split and then had its section deleted is held by the served-
// binding note at the top of the boot gate, because its infrastructure state is
// in a binding no work-store reader will ever look at.

// storage status` reaches the binding three times in one invocation
// (infraBindingCensus, reportBindingRelics, and classifyInfraContainmentGap),
// and one writer among them is enough to checkpoint. `gc storage preflight`
// reaches it through the census and infraDestinationPreflightRefusal. A new
// read added to either command belongs here too.
//
// These commands are documented read-only and they run against a LIVE city — a
// deploy gate may run either as often as it likes while a controller is serving
// the database. Reaching the binding through the migration's writer opener would
// leave that contract resting on what the writer opener happens to do today
// rather than on what the connection is able to do: a read-write connection
// CAN checkpoint the WAL on close, which rewrites the main database and the
// -wal of a store something else is serving, with zero logical writes. A
// mode=ro connection cannot take the write lock, so it can neither mutate a row
// nor checkpoint, and every file the binding already had stays byte-identical
// across open/read/close (beads.WithSQLiteStoreReadOnly).
//
// What it does leave behind, on a binding nothing else has open, is the -wal
// and -shm pair SQLite materializes to read a WAL-mode database: a connection
// that cannot take the write lock cannot remove them on close either. On the
// case that motivates this opener — a city whose controller is serving the
// binding — both are already on disk and held open, so there is nothing to add
// and nothing to remove. Removing them is the writer opener's ability, and the

//   - A bare mountpoint that is present, world-readable and empty is

// precisely the conflation that let the drop go unnoticed. Every store on the
// deployed migration path answers: the SQLite and native-Dolt leaves read their
// own column, MemStore reports honestly that it has no way to hold a payload
// and the file store answers through the MemStore it embeds (asserted in
// internal/beads/filestore.go so a refactor cannot quietly mute it), and the
// caching, policy, and strict wrappers forward. What
// remains mute is beads.BdStore and the exec store, whose payloads live behind a
// bd process that offers no dependency-metadata read today (bd dep add takes no
// metadata flag; a payload reaches bd only through a create --graph plan, and bd
// dep list --json does not report it). A city on either of those is refused by
// name until that read exists — tracked as ga-qcpgy.
//
// The per-edge read stays even though importInfraSnapshot reads every edge
// again a moment later. It is what `gc storage preflight` runs to answer "would
// a read fail inside my window", and the preflight opens no destination, so a
// refusal that lived only in the import would be one the rehearsal could not
// reach.
//
// The scope is edges whose BOTH endpoints are infra, matching what the copy
// actually re-adds. A cross-boundary edge into work is not carried at all — it

// destination owns no row for the far endpoint); they are NOT skipped in the
// reverse direction, because nothing in this migration writes one, so a
// destination that has one did not get it from here. And a dep type is compared
// only when both sides carry one: the destination normalizes an empty type to
// its own default, so an empty source type is evidence of nothing.
//
// # The edge payload is witnessed next door, not here
//
// The source's dependency rows carry a metadata JSON column, written in
// production by every formula step with a waits_for gate. It is not a field of
// beads.Dep — it is a sidecar reached by asking a store about one pair — so no
// comparison over this struct can see it, and the field-sync guard over
// beads.Dep cannot cover it either. infraEdgePayloadDifference witnesses it,
// both directions, on the same edges this function compares structurally.
//
// Splitting them is deliberate: this one is a pure function of two edge slices
// and stays testable as such, while the payload comparison has to read both
// stores and can fail. Folding the reads in here would give every caller —
// including the recovery path, which compares edges it did not write — an error
// return it has nothing to do with.
