// The agreement predicate: would a T-worker's own query serve this row?
//
// The pool is a PULL system. The controller does not choose which bead a seat
// picks up; it scales capacity on evidence that work exists, and the worker
// discovers and claims for itself. That only converges if the two readers agree
// about what counts as work for a template — and they did not.
//
// The controller's demand loop counted any ready, unassigned row whose route
// normalized to T. The worker's Tier-3 query serves a strictly smaller set: it
// passes --exclude-type=epic and one --exclude-label per dispatch hold, and it
// matches the route by EXACT string. So three classes of row were permanent
// capacity demand that no worker could ever claim:
//
//   - a routed EPIC (an unassigned parent has no executable spec — the query
//     excludes it deliberately, workquery.go),
//   - a bead parked on hold:mayor / hold:external (parked precisely because the
//     next actor is not this worker),
//   - a route stamped with a live slot suffix, "<base>-N", which the demand side
//     normalizes to <base> and every raw consumer rejects.
//
// Each one spawns a seat, the seat's hook reads empty, it drains, and the
// controller counts the row again on the next tick. Forever.
//
// This file is the one predicate both sides now answer with. The serving rules
// come from internal/config — the same value the shell flags are rendered from —
// so a flag the query gains cannot silently fail to reach the controller. The
// route half mirrors hookClaimMatchesRoute exactly, because that is the function
// that will actually accept or reject the claim.
//
// One rule here has no serving-side twin yet: controlRowServableByTemplate, the
// control-dispatcher ownership rule. The controller applies it to demand, but
// the dispatcher's serve loop still claims by route alone (mc-zndi7.85), so for
// a cross-scope control row the two sides do not yet agree.

// opens through bd-native state independently of its target's own status
// (internal/formula/compile.go mints exactly that shape, a gate edge onto a step
// that stays open; native_dolt_store.go's ready filter states it directly — "a
// waits-for edge gates on the spawner's children rather than the spawner's own
// status" — and declines the full predicate for the same reason), bdstore.go's
// inline-dep derivation records that the flat DependencySatisfied rule "is
// deliberately NOT reused" for a row bd has already offered, and the
// `bd-gate-open` fixture pins the counterexample: a waits-for edge onto an OPEN
// target reads is_blocked = 0, bd's ready OFFERS the row, and the direct-dep
// predicate would hide it. Reusing that predicate here — in the one situation
// where the row's blockedness is already unsettled — would second-guess a bd
