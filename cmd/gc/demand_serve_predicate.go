// The agreement predicate: would a T-worker's own query serve this row?
//
// The pool is a PULL system. The controller does not choose which bead a seat
// picks up; it scales capacity on evidence that work exists, and the worker
// discovers and claims for itself. That only converges if the two readers agree
// about what counts as work for a template — and they did not.
//
// The controller's demand loop counted any ready, unassigned row whose route
// normalized to T. The worker's Tier-3 query serves a strictly smaller set: it
// passes --exclude-type=epic and one --exclude-label per dispatch hold, and it
// matches the route by EXACT string. So four classes of row were permanent
// capacity demand that no worker could ever claim:
//
//   - a routed EPIC (an unassigned parent has no executable spec — the query
//     excludes it deliberately, workquery.go),
//   - a bead parked on hold:mayor / hold:external (parked precisely because the
//     next actor is not this worker),
//   - a route stamped with a live slot suffix, "<base>-N", which the demand side
//     normalizes to <base> and every raw consumer rejects,
//   - a workflow-topology bead — a graph.v2 root, a scope latch, a step-spec
//     sidecar — which carries a route but no executable body, and which the
//     hook's own filter strips before a worker ever sees it (gc-dz64s).
//
// Each one spawns a seat, the seat's hook reads empty, it drains, and the
// controller counts the row again on the next tick. Forever.
//
// This file is the one predicate both sides now answer with. The serving rules
// come from internal/config — the same value the shell flags are rendered from —
// so a flag the query gains cannot silently fail to reach the controller. The
// route half mirrors hookClaimMatchesRoute exactly, because that is the function
// that will actually accept or reject the claim.
