// This file is the two-topology fixture the split-store conformance suite
// (split_topology_conformance_test.go) runs every invariant over.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS: the split-store bug class — code answering "which store owns
// this class of bead?" differently on different paths — is the one this repo
// keeps paying for, and two of its instances reached production. Order-tracking
// beads were created in the work store on a split city (#5127) and accrued
// stranded infrastructure rows until boot refused; `bd sql` kept reading the
// work ledger for relocated graph ids and reported every live molecule root as
// missing (#5125). Both were single-topology fixes: the code was correct on one
// store arrangement and wrong on the other, and nothing ran the same assertion
// on both.
//
// So the fixture builds ONE city twice — single-store and split — and
// forEachTopology runs the invariant body over both. An invariant that encodes
// ownership correctly passes in both; a path that hard-codes one store fails the
// other immediately.
//
// # Fidelity: where each leaf comes from, and what is deliberately NOT wrapped
//
// The leaves are splittest's strict, prefix-disjoint doubles rather than plain
// MemStores, because a MemStore accepts a foreign-prefix create and a dangling
// dep without a word and would make a residence invariant vacuous. Each leaf
// declares the backend it models, which is what production runs:
//
//   - work: BdSemantics, minting "gc-" — bd/Dolt, which hard-fails a mismatched
//     --id and an unresolvable dep endpoint.
//   - class: a REAL beads.SQLiteStore behind SQLiteSemantics, minting the graph
//     class's reserved "gcg-" — the store internal/storebinding/sqlite's
//     OpenEngine opens for the whole split (ONE engine serving all five
//     infrastructure classes, opened with
//     config.ReservedClassPrefix(BeadClassGraph)). It ACCEPTS a residence
//     violation and records it, because SQLite does — and it carries the two
//     capabilities the binding really has and a MemStore leaf does not: the
//     compare-and-swap assignment claim a routed claim acquires through, and
//     the graph applier. See newSplitEnvClassLeaf.
//
// The wrapping is asymmetric on purpose, and the asymmetry is production's, not
// the fixture's: main.go and api_state.go put every WORK store (city and rig)
// behind wrapStoreWithBeadPolicies, while openStorageRoutes keys the class map
// straight to the value the provider's OpenEngine returned. So a relocated class
// store has no bead-policy layer: no create-time storage policy, no read-tier
// expansion. splitEnv.policyWrapped reports which leg a topology's front door is
// on, and the invariants that care assert through it rather than assuming.
//
// That claim is ENFORCED, not just stated:
// TestSplitEnvClassStoreWrappingMatchesOpenStorageRoutes opens routes through
// the real seam and fails if openStorageRoutes ever hands back a policy-wrapped
// class store. Without it the fixture would be free to keep modeling a topology
// production no longer serves, because nothing else in cmd/gc asserts the
// wrapping of the store that function returns.
//
// Accepted fidelity gap: the WORK leaf is in-memory rather than real bd/Dolt
// behind CachingStore (the class leaf is a real SQLite store on disk). The real
// openers are covered by the managed-Dolt and storage-boot integration tests.

// splitEnv is the two-topology store fixture. Every field carries the production
// shape for its topology:
//
//   - split=true: routes relocate all five infrastructure classes to one class
//     store, exactly as storageSplitWhole/openStorageRoutes arrange them, and
//     cfg.Storage says the same thing so config-derived answers
//     (relocatedBeadClasses, storageSplitShapeOf) agree with the routes.
//   - split=false: routes is nil and resolveClassStore's identity branch
//     collapses every class onto the work store, byte-identical to a city that
//     authors no [storage] section at all.
//
// work is the policy-wrapped front door a call site holds as "the city bead
// store". Per-class ownership is DERIVED from it through classStore/graphStore,
// never assumed, so an invariant exercises the same dispatch production makes.
