// A started graph workflow is the single live dispatch surface for the work it
// drives, and it establishes that by retiring gc.routed_to on its bead
// (internal/sling: retireClaimRoute). gc.run_target survives that retire on
// purpose — it is the archived route reopen-source and this recovery restore
// the bead from once the workflow is gone (ga-20zd) — so without this gate the
// retire lasts exactly until the next pass, which re-promotes the archived
// route and hands the pool a bead the workflow is already dispatching. That is
// the double dispatch the retire exists to prevent (gc-p64nt), reintroduced one
// pass later: two polecats on one branch.
//
// Liveness — not the mere presence of a link — is the gate, so the answer stops
// being true the moment the workflow reaches a terminal status and the bead
// becomes recoverable again. A marker that outlived its workflow would strand
// the bead in the one state this recovery exists to heal.
//
// Both launch shapes are checked because they leave different links behind. A
// convoy-first pour (the graph.v2 shape: `gc sling <bead> --on <formula>` mints
// a synthetic input convoy over the bead) clears gc.source_bead_id and links
// back only through gc.input_convoy_id -> the convoy -> its tracked members,
// which is the reverse walk. A workflow attached to a source bead instead
// stamps that bead's workflow_id with the root id, and carries no input convoy
// to walk. Neither link alone sees the other's shape.
