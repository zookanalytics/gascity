// The observation cache (CONTRACT I3) holds runtime facts only: what the
// providers showed, keyed by runtime session name, so an ownerless runtime is
// as visible as an owned one. Session bead state is the census, not this.
//
// Every fact is three-valued (Unknown, No, Yes) and carries when it was
// observed and by whom. Three rules keep a stale or partial view from reading
// as the truth:
//
//   - A fact older than maxAge reads Unknown, at the reader's clock: a
//     published snapshot is immutable, so staleness cannot be written into it.
//   - Absence is concluded only by a complete, attested pass on the backend
//     that last listed the name, or, once a provider swap removed that
//     backend, by a pass on which every backend is complete. Any other
//     outcome leaves the name's facts alone to age out.
//   - Before a backend's first complete pass within the current provider,
//     every fact about names on it reads Unknown.
//

// fresh three-outcome probes. Readers load the snapshot pointer without a
// lock, and a published snapshot's maps are never mutated.
