package main

// `gc storage` — the operator surface for a city's storage-class layout.
//
// The whole tree is built from the two constants this program spells its
// operator commands in: storageMigrationCommand for the cutover and
// storageRecoveryCommand for the stranded-write repair. The refusals print
// those same constants (infra_class_migrate.go), so building the commands from
// them is what stops a refusal and a command from drifting apart in the one
// direction that matters: a refusal naming a command the binary does not carry
// is an operator instruction that fails at the shell — and a refusal naming no
// command at all is the defect the repair verb was added to close.
//
// The source is stated explicitly rather than detected. `migrate` carries one
// source shape — the work store this city is running on — and refuses if the
// operator does not name it, so a second source added later cannot inherit this
// one's behavior by silence. There is no dispatch table for that second source
// yet, on purpose: with one arm a table is shape without content, and an arm
// added later owns its own preflight, copy, proof and markers end to end,
// sharing nothing implicitly except the guard and the refusal grammar.

//
// This is a DRAIN gauge, not the residence probe's retirement condition — the
// two parted company in ga-qdt5y.19. Retirement asks whether the binding can
// hold an id at all, and a closed relic still answers yes: the migration never
// deleted the work store's frozen pre-migration copy, so retiring on the last
// CLOSE would serve that id from the frozen copy forever. So the verdict counts
// closed residents (storeref.LegacyResidents) and this count deliberately does
// not — an operator draining a migrated city needs a number that reaches zero,
// and the widened one never can.
//
// What reaching zero means, then, is that the carried-across work is finished,
// not that the per-read cost is gone. A city that migrated any beads keeps its
// probe for good.
//
// It never changes the exit code. A relic is the migration working as designed,
// so a status command that failed over one would report every city that ever
// migrated as broken. A binding that cannot be read is reported and skipped for
// the same reason: the layout facts above it stand on their own.
//
// It reads through openInfraBindingReadOnly for the reason that opener states:
// its only caller runs past the convergence gate in doStorageStatus, which is
// the arm a controller can be serving, and a read-write connection there could
// checkpoint the WAL of a live binding on close. The gate is also the
// precondition read-only needs — infraConvergenceMarked means the database is
// present — so no extra stat is required here.
