// The stranded-write repair: how the infrastructure beads a converged city's
// proven copy never carried get into the binding that is already serving.
//
// This is the recovery half of the hazard infra_class_migrate.go documents
// under "Writers, and the stranded-write window". A write that lands in the
// retained work store after the equality stage is absent from the binding, the
// per-boot containment re-check names it, and the boot refuses. The refusal
// used to tell the operator to recover the named beads into the binding's
// database and then stop — there was no command that did it, and the alarm
// named no verb. This is that command.
//
// # Why this is not `gc storage migrate` run twice
//
// The migration is one-shot BY DESIGN, and the gate is a safety property rather
// than an accident of sequencing. Two independent holds make re-running it
// wrong on a converged city:
//
//   - runInfraClassMigration reads the convergence state first and hands a
//     marked city straight to confirmInfraConvergence. It never re-copies.
//   - If the marker were removed to force the copy, prepareInfraDestination
//     would either refuse (any destination row without the migration's own
//     provenance stamp is content the migration did not write) or, on a
//     destination it did write, DELETE every stamped row and re-import from a
//     source that no longer holds them. The second arm is the loss, and it has
//     been measured rather than imagined: on the city this command was built
//     for, the binding held 51,127 rows and the retained source held 1,452, so
//     forcing a re-copy would have replaced the former with the latter. The
//     retained source's infrastructure slice shrinks over a city's life —
//     the whole point of the retained-source design is that the binding, not
//     the source, is authoritative after cutover.
//
// And the equality stage cannot pass on a live city at all: verifyInfraCopy
// demands the destination hold EXACTLY the source's infrastructure slice, while
// a serving binding legitimately grows beads the source never had.
//
// So this does not defeat that gate, and nothing here should be refactored into
// it. It is a scoped repair built from the same primitives, and everything it
// moves is additive: it copies only ids the binding does not hold and the
// manifest does not record, it never deletes a destination row, and it never
// writes to the source.
//
// # What it will not guess at
//
// The gap it repairs is classified by exactly the rule confirmInfraConvergence
// uses, against exactly the manifest that check reads, using coordclass as the
// classification authority — because a repair that disagreed with the guard
// would move beads and leave the boot refusing anyway.
//
// A bead whose class this cannot state is reported rather than moved: an
// infrastructure classification outside the classes the split relocates, a row
// whose class would change in the crossing, or a row whose dependency topology
// the source cannot state, is a bead nobody can say belongs in this binding in
// the shape it would arrive in. Those are named and the command exits non-zero.
//
// # Copy before delete, verify before record
//
// Nothing is deleted, from either side. The source keeps its rows verbatim, as
// it does after the migration, so a bad outcome here is a duplicate rather than
// a loss. The manifest — the record every later boot classifies absence
// against — is extended only after every moved bead has been re-read from a
// CLOSED AND REOPENED destination and proven field-, class- and dep-equal to
// the source, by the migration's own comparators.
//
// # The topology is repaired over the whole resident set, not over the copy
//
// An edge belongs to a PAIR of beads, and the two endpoints of a within-infra
// edge need not arrive in the binding on the same run: the dispatcher's normal
// wiring direction is a pre-existing bead blocking on a just-created one, so a
// bead that crossed at cutover routinely gains an edge into one written after
// it. So the edge pass runs over every source infrastructure bead the binding
// holds once the copy finishes — inbound and outbound, this run's rows and the
// cutover's alike — exactly as importInfraSnapshot runs its dep pass over every
// row rather than over the ones it happened to create. Only edges the binding
// lacks are written, so the pass is a diff rather than a rewrite and its count
// is a statement: "0 restored" is what a converged city reports.
//
// An edge that cannot be written is NAMED, per edge, and never reported as
// something else. There are three ways to not write one and they are three
// different facts: the far endpoint is a work bead (the destination owns no row
// for it, exactly as the migration leaves it); the far endpoint is a bead the
// manifest records and the binding's own GC has since collected (re-adding it
// would dangle a reference to a deliberate delete); or the far endpoint is an
// infrastructure bead THIS RUN REFUSED TO MOVE, which is a within-infra edge
// this repair is dropping, and is reported as a refusal rather than counted as
// linkage.
//
// # Idempotence, and what a partial failure leaves
//
// Re-running is a no-op AND a repair: the gap is recomputed from live state, a
// bead already in the binding is not re-copied, every missing within-infra edge
// between resident beads is re-driven, and the manifest is rewritten as a
// superset.
//
// A partial failure — ENOSPC, a read-only binding root, a kill — can leave rows
// in the binding that the manifest does not record, because the rows are written
// row by row and the manifest is published once at the end. Those ids are NOT
// still stranded: the binding holds them, so no containment check names them,
// and the earlier claim that the residue was self-healing was false for exactly
// the ids that got copied. Left unrecorded, the day the binding's own GC
// collects one it reads back as a strand and the city refuses to boot over a row
// the repair had correctly delivered.
//
// So the residue is a bucket of its own: every source infrastructure bead the
// binding holds that the manifest does not record is re-proven against the
// reopened destination by the same comparators the moved rows face, and folded
// into the manifest. One that cannot be proven — a row under that id that is not
// the source's row — is named and left unrecorded, because the manifest's
// meaning is "the copy was proven to deliver this id" and recording an unproven
// one would be a proof nobody made.
//
// This is the asymmetry with the migration, stated so it is not re-introduced:
// an interrupted runInfraClassMigration self-heals, because the manifest is
// written before the marker and the next run's prepareInfraDestination drops the
// stamped rows and re-imports. This repair writes into an already-converged
// binding it must never clear, so its resume is recognition rather than
// rollback.
//
// # The rig census is deliberately not repeated here
//
// doStorageMigrate refuses while any rig scope holds an infrastructure bead,
// because the copy's source is the city work store and a rig-scoped row would
// be silently omitted from a cutover that then declares itself proven. This
// repair makes no such declaration: it extends a manifest with ids it copied
// out of the city work store and asserts nothing about any other scope, and the
// containment re-check it feeds reads the same one store. Refusing on a rig
// stray would block the repair of a real strand over a bead that is outside
// both the repair's reach and the check's.
