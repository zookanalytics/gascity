// The external-reads lane (CONTRACT C0.4 as amended by C4). The v2
// allocator's pass does no live I/O, but a leg its cache cannot feed (bd
// ledgers, native Dolt, Postgres) cannot answer demand from that cache: bd
// folds blocked work into "open" (EB-42o8), and out-of-process bd writes
// reach the cache only at its re-scan. So this one lane runs every live or
// slow read the allocator needs, off the pass, and publishes the results as
// one recording that v2DemandReads and the decide's scale_check input serve
// from.
//
// A pass reads its sources concurrently, each in its own goroutine, at most
// one read in flight per source: every lane-fed leg in any demand leg set
// (the work census, the default-probe target stores) through
// legacyDemandReads; when the config has an on_demand named session,
// the city store's closed named-session index on any leg, since no
// CachingStore holds closed history, read through the controller's
// closedNamedIndexCache when the env carries one; and the custom scale_check
// commands (I5).
//
// The source deadline bounds only how long a pass waits before it publishes;
// it never decides whether a read counts. Each read stores its result when it
// ends, whenever that is, stamped when it started (C5.4(3)) and ended. A pass
// publishes, for each source it reads, the latest ended result, which stays
// fresh for 3 × patrol from its own end; a read still in flight at publish is
// marked on that result (InFlightSince), and a read that ends after its pass
// published wakes the lane, whose next pass publishes it. Only a source with
// no result yet whose read has outlived its budget publishes
// errSourceTimeout. A leg turns partial only when its result goes stale or
// failed. The lane wakes the allocator when a publish changes content or
// turns a stale source fresh.
//
// After publishing, the pass starts its due steps, each on its own goroutine
// under a deadline, one run in flight per step, so a slow step never delays
// the reads. The first step is legacy's demand-pass repairs
// (POOL-019/020), at most once a minute from the end of
// the last run, in legacy order over every leg: the session stamp, the
// control-dispatcher route repair (which emits control.dispatcher_scope_gap
// itself), and the four migration repairs. The four stay in the lane by owner
// decision (2026-10-05): ops step G′'s counts were never taken, and the doctor
// --fix move is re-measured after cutover. Those writes run only under v2;
// legacy keeps them in its tick, so the two never both run. The planner
// runtime adds C8's waits, nudges and orphan-release steps
// (reconcile_steps_*.go). A closed wait dependency runs the waits step alone,
// without reading the legs (GUAR-010).
//
// The lane always reads, suspended city or not (CONTRACT v5 R4), so a
// suspended city's drains keep their work reads. Only its steps keep
// legacy's suspension gate: while the city is suspended a pass starts none,
// as legacy's demand pass returns before its repairs (POOL-001). The lane
// serves only v2.
//
// The lane is paced at the patrol interval and woken by key-less socket and
// API pokes (a CLI writer such as gc sling pokes key-less), a supervisor
// reload, a store swap after the barrier, a resume, a create that wrote a row
// on a lane-fed leg, and a read that ended after its pass published.
