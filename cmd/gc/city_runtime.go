		// we observed pool sessions with state=active, last_woke=empty

		// The guard matches both "active" and "awake" because the

		// the state transition by CommitStartedPatch / ConfirmStartedPatch
		// and restamped by recoverRunningPendingCreate on heal. A bead
		// is protected while creation_complete_at is recent (within
		// postCreateProtectionTimeout). The guard intentionally ignores
		// last_woke_at: wake bookkeeping can land before the first steady-state
		// patrol, and a just-started bead must not become sweepable simply
		// because that field was already populated. crash/churn paths do not
		// touch creation_complete_at, so a post-crash bead whose last
		// successful start was longer than the timeout ago is sweepable even
		// when wake_attempts or churn_count are non-zero. The age bound mirrors
		// staleCreatingState: a missing or zero creation_complete_at is
		// treated as stale (sweepable) so beads without the per-start
		// marker (older builds, manually repaired) stay recoverable.
		//
		// Upgrade contract: older binaries did not write

		// fails the age check and becomes sweepable. That matches the

		// and is the intended behavior — a bead that survived a binary
