// The boot gate against the compiled beads workspace provider.
//
// These are the arms that need no workspace at all: a city whose work store
// still holds infrastructure beads never reaches the binding, a city under
// native transport "off" is refused before it does, and a city whose
// configured workspace is not there is refused by the open. The serving arm
// needs a real workspace and lives beside these under the integration tag.
//
// None of them stands in the city. The working directory is deliberately left
// wherever the test binary started, because a gate that resolved a binding
// against the process rather than against the city would pass every test that
// chdir'd into the city first — and would send every city a supervisor hosts
// to the same wrong directory in production.
