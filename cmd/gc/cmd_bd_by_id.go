package main

// The in-process by-ID surface for `gc bd`.
//
// `gc bd` resolves a WORK scope and hands the command to the `bd` subprocess.
// On a city whose coordination classes are served from a non-work [storage]
// binding, an infrastructure bead lives in that binding and not in the work
// workspace bd is pointed at, so a by-ID read of one is answered by a
// subprocess that cannot see it: bd opens the work backend instead, which on a
// managed-Dolt city means a connect attempt that can block for the whole
// command, and otherwise means an empty answer indistinguishable from a real
// one.
//
// So an id whose owning class is the relocated binding is answered HERE,
// through that class's closed front door, and the subprocess is never spawned.
//
// # Where the store comes from, and why not from the migration
//
// The store is resolved through the one-shot storage funnel
// (cli_storage_routes.go), which takes the same verdict the controller takes at
// boot and opens the binding through the planned provider's own EngineOpener.
//
// The obvious alternative — resolveInfraBindingTarget, the migration's own
// destination resolver — is the defect this file was written to avoid, and it
// is worth naming because it looks like the right function. That resolver
// answers "is this a binding THIS BUILD can migrate onto", which is true only
// of the built-in SQLite engine: it returns not-configured for a beads
// workspace, for a fork's own engine, and for every provider added after it.
// A by-ID surface gated on that answer routes correctly for one provider and
// falls through to the subprocess for all the others — which is the wrong-answer
// lane this surface exists to close, reappearing on exactly the cities that
// moved furthest from the default. The question a READ has is not "can I
// migrate this", it is "where is this class served from", and the funnel
// answers that for every provider because the answer comes from the provider.
//
// # This IS the shared candidate list, with the work leg served by bd
//
// storeref.ClassCandidates is the tree's by-id resolver, and its answer for a
// relocated city is [class, work] — the class store first, because it is the
// reserved namespace's AUTHORITY, then the work store, because authority is not
// exclusive possession. The class store is not the namespace's only MINTER
// either: a rig configured with a prefix inside one mints work beads there, and
// `gc storage migrate` preserved ids in the other direction. Leading is a
// statement about probe ORDER, never about who could have created the id. This
// surface probes exactly that list in exactly that order.
// What differs is only how the work leg is READ: here it is the `bd`
// subprocess, which is why the leg appears as a fall-through rather than as a
// beads.Store. The in-process form of the same list, for the one-shot commands
// that hold two ordinary stores, is by_id_store_route.go.
//
// The class leg is probed for ids outside the class namespace too, not only
// for ids inside it, because `gc storage migrate` preserves ids — so a bead the
// migration relocated keeps its HQ/rig-era prefix, and without a residence
// probe its reads are answered from the work store's retained pre-migration
// copy, frozen at migration time. That probe is storeref's, not this surface's:
// resolve runs the shared plan, which keeps the probe for exactly as long as
// the binding has not been certified free of relics. See resolve.
//
// # Three deliberate properties
//
//   - The routed operations take ONLY the closed contract
//     (storebinding.GraphStore). They cannot reach a raw bead store through
//     their parameter, so claim/release CAS lives in the store the contract is
//     bound to and is never re-implemented as a read-then-write in the CLI.
//   - A binding MISS is a fall-through, for every id. The binding is the
//     authority for its reserved namespaces, not their only lawful holder: a
//     rig may be configured with a prefix inside one (config.ValidateRigs
//     allows it and ReservedPrefixWarnings only advises), and `gc storage
//     migrate` preserved ids in the other direction. So "the binding does not
//     hold it" is a statement about the binding, and the ledger the passthrough
//     is pointed at answers next. Answering absence here instead stranded every
//     read and every write addressed at such a rig's own beads.
//   - A resolution failure surfaces. Reading "the binding could not be opened"
//     as "the bead is not there" is the root-loss shape this whole lane exists
//     to prevent. On a city this build must not serve, an id only the class
//     binding could own gets the boot refusal that names the remedy — never
//     absence, and never the work store's answer. A WORK id on that same city
//     keeps its existing path, because the refusal is a fact about the city's
//     storage and says nothing about a bead the work ledger still serves. See
//     resolve.
//
// Served here: show, update (fields and metadata, including --claim), close,
// reopen, release-if-current, dep list, and dep tree. `gc bd heartbeat` is not — it
// forwards to bd's native owner-only lease-refresh verb (commit 80aad8c), a
// literal spelling parseBdByIDOp does not recognize, and it is no longer
// rewritten to a metadata update the way it once was. On a city that relocates
// the owning class a heartbeat of a bead the binding HOLDS is not a
// fall-through: the ownership gate below (bdArgsAddressedClassIDs) puts the id
// to the residence walk, and a hit is refused by refuseClassOwnedTarget, which
// names the routing cause rather than letting the work store answer with bd's
// not-found. A miss falls through with every other binding miss, so a rig whose
// prefix shadows the namespace keeps bd's own heartbeat against its own ledger.
// The general query surface is likewise unserved, and
// bd_relocated_classes.go refuses it on its own terms.
//
// close and reopen are here for the same reason update is, one lifecycle step
// further on. A class store MINTS ids from its binding workspace's own prefix,
// so a synthetic it creates with no id — an input convoy, a patrol root, a
// wisp — carries a WORK prefix while residing only in the binding. Reads found
// those (the class leg is probed for every id); the close that would retire one
// was not a by-ID verb at all, so it never opened this door, fell through to a
// subprocess pointed at the prefix store, and died there with bd's not-found.
// Every such open bead was a permanent ready-frontier polluter with no
// supported drain path.
//
// A close this door serves does NOT reach the ADR-0009 work-record close gate,
// which doBd runs later. The coverage boundary and why it is sound are recorded
// where the gate defines itself, in work_record_gate.go's header.
//
// # Ownership is decided before servability
//
// An operation that is NOT served but whose subject the class binding HOLDS
// does not fall through either: bd would open the work store, which cannot see
// the bead, and the command would hang or answer about the wrong workspace. It
// is refused instead, before the subprocess.
//
// Ownership is one question with one answer: RESIDENCE. A reserved prefix is
// what decides which ids get ASKED — bdArgsAddressedClassIDs reads them from the
// argv, so every reserved id is put to the binding even in an invocation the
// mutation scanner cannot reduce to subjects — and residence is what decides
// the answer. Reading the prefix as the answer instead was the defect this
// door carried: the binding is its namespaces' authority, not their only lawful
// holder, so every id a shadow-prefixed rig minted was refused on a proof that
// did not hold. The other half of the population runs the same walk from the
// other end: a MUTATION whose positional ids are unambiguous is probed even
// though its ids carry a work prefix, because `gc storage migrate` preserved
// ids and its relics reside in the binding. Without that a work-prefixed class
// resident got no protection at all — its `--notes` update or its `delete` fell
// through to a ledger that cannot hold it and died with bd's not-found, which
// reads as "the bead is gone" rather than "you addressed the wrong store".
//
// Ownership and servability are answered by different code on purpose, and
// answering them with one function was a real defect rather than a
// hypothetical. The served parsers reject every flag they do not implement, so
// "can this be served" said no to `show --long`, `show --id`, `dep list -t` and
// the rest of bd's own manifest — and while a rejection meant fall-through,
// those were precisely the invocations sent to the ledger that cannot answer.
// Which ids to ask about is now decided by bdArgsAddressedClassIDs, which reads
// only the argv and knows nothing about what this surface implements.
//
// The id asked about is read from an ID POSITION and never from an id-shaped
// value. A `gc bd list --metadata-field workflow_id=gcg-…` probe quotes a class
// id rather than addressing one, so this surface declines it — OWNERSHIP is not
// what is wrong with it. A `--parent gcg-…` DOES address one, so it is put to
// the binding — and the binding's answer, not the prefix, is what happens next.
// A parent the binding holds is refused, because letting the work store answer
// that returns a silent empty result. A parent it cleanly misses falls through,
// and bd runs the create against the work ledger, which is the right ledger for
// the population this door re-routed: a shadow-prefix rig referencing its own
// bead. An id no ledger holds is bd's own dep validation to reject, not this
// door's to guess about.
//
// Declining is not forwarding. That same selector is refused one pre-flight
// earlier, by bd_relocated_classes.go, and for a different reason: `list` is a
// PROJECTION over a class this ledger cannot see, so its `[]` is a confident
// wrong answer whatever the id's position. The two doors ask different
// questions — "who owns this bead" and "can this ledger answer this verb at
// all" — and only the first one is answered here.
//
// # What entering costs, and who pays it
//
// Resolving the funnel loads the city config, resolves a storage plan, opens a
// binding and — on a born-split city — re-proves its invariant with a full work
// store census. That is once per process, memoized with every other one-shot
// command's routing, but it is not free, so it is paid only by an invocation
// that could concern a class-owned bead: a served by-ID form, an argv that
// addresses a reserved-prefix id, or a MUTATION with unambiguous positional
// ids. An ordinary work READ or SELECTOR never enters; a mutation addressing
// ids enters exactly once per process.
//
// The mutation arm is the widening, and the id shape is why it cannot be
// narrower. A class store mints from its binding workspace's own prefix and
// `gc storage migrate` preserves ids, so "gc-123" says nothing about which
// store holds the row — only a probe does, and skipping it is what sent every
// unserved mutation of a class resident to the ledger that cannot hold it.
// Reads and selectors stay outside because they address no subject whose
// residence could decide anything: a selector QUOTES ids, and a read that this
// surface serves is already inside. An ambiguous scan stays outside too, for
// the plainest reason — it yields no ids to probe.

// bdArgsAddressedClassIDs returns EVERY reserved-prefix id an invocation

// spelling from reaching the work ledger. Returning all addressed ids — not just
// the first — is what makes a multi-subject verb's protection independent of the
// order the subjects were typed (see refuseUnservedClassMutation).
//
// It exists because the served parsers are deliberately strict: they reject
// every flag they do not implement, and a rejection used to mean the command
// fell through to the subprocess. bd's own manifest names the spellings that
// took that exit — `show --long/--short/--children/--refs/--thread/
// --include-comments/--include-dependents/--as-of/--id`, `dep list -t/--type/
// --direction` — so the very flags an operator reaches for when the terse
// answer is not enough were the ones routed at the ledger that cannot answer.
// Ownership is therefore decided HERE, independently of whether this surface
// can serve the command, and an unserved spelling on a class-owned bead is
// refused rather than forwarded.
//
// # ID position
//
// An id is ADDRESSED when it is a positional token, or the value of a flag that
// takes a bead id. It is merely QUOTED when it is the value of any other flag,
// and a quoted id decides nothing ABOUT OWNERSHIP: `gc bd list --metadata-field
// workflow_id=gcg-…` selects work rows by a field they carry, so no bead of the
// relocated class is being addressed and this walk collects no id from it.
//
// An empty result here does not mean forwarded. The selector dialect guard in
// bd_relocated_classes.go runs first and refuses that same argv on servability
// — a projection whose predicate names a namespace this ledger holds no row
// under cannot answer it, and `[]` is a confident wrong answer. What this walk
// must not do is claim OWNERSHIP from a quoted id, because that decides which
// STORE serves the read, and a quoted id says nothing about that.
//
// The value/positional split comes from bdflags — the tree's own manifest of
// what each subcommand's flags consume — rather than from a local list, so a
// flag bd grows does not silently become an id position here. The id-valued
// subset is local because bdflags records arity, not meaning.
//
// # Failing closed
//
// Two things can stop the walk from deciding: an unresolvable subcommand and an
// unknown flag, and both mean the same thing — from here on, nothing can be
// told from a value. Both widen the scan rather than ending it: every remaining
// token is treated as addressed. That is the same choice bdRelocatedClassVerb
// makes and it is bounded the same way, because only a token that actually
