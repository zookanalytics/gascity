// relocated session backend once [beads.classes.sessions] moves — the split-brain
// this migration closes. These files must never regress to
// constructing the session front door straight from the generic work store.
//
// providers.go is a shared provider-construction helper rather than a one-shot
// command root, but it is listed because its loadProviderSessionSnapshot session
// read — the gc:session ListByLabel, off a store it opens itself independent of
// the caller — is routed. It carries no `sessionFrontDoor(store...)` construction,
// so there is no substring false-positive risk and the positive `cliSessionStore(`
// tripwire protects that route the same way it protects the command roots.
// providers.go carries a SECOND routed session path: openCityMailProvider builds
// the CLI mail provider as a two-store beadmail (message persistence on the
// messaging-class store, mail's session reads/writes — session.ListAllSessionBeads
// / ResolveSessionID / RepairEmptyType — on the session-class store via
// cliSessionStore), so the mail addressing/identity session access a
// [beads.classes.sessions] relocation must capture is routed here too (the former
// two-store mail-provider follow-up, now closed for the session class). Both the
// snapshot route and the mail route carry the positive cliSessionStore( tripwire
// and no sessionFrontDoor(store...) construction; the end-to-end acceptance test
// remains the authoritative completeness check.
//
// The gc status trio (cmd_status.go, cmd_citystatus.go, city_status_snapshot.go)
// is listed even though none of them constructs a session front door: their
// session access is non-front-door (loadStatusSessionSnapshot → ListAllSessionBeads,
// namedSessionStatusForCity → resolveSessionIDWithConfig + store.Get,
// collectCitySessionCounts → workerSessionCatalogWithConfig), all routed through
// cliSessionStore, while the store-health probe (buildCityStoreHealth →
// collectStoreHealth → store.List) deliberately stays on the generic work store it
// measures. The negative sessionFrontDoor(store...) needles are inert for these
// files; the positive cliSessionStore( tripwire protects the routed reads the same
// way it protects providers.go's snapshot route, consistent with this guard being
// a regression canary rather than a completeness proof.
//
// controller.go is intentionally ABSENT even though it routes: its
// session-circuit-reset socket handler routes, but the file also holds the
// already-safe param-threaded runtime `sessionFrontDoor(store.Store)` at the
// gracefulStop path, which the substring needle cannot distinguish. It is
// protected by in-code comments and the end-to-end relocation acceptance test
// rather than this file-level guard.
//
// cmd_start.go's standalone reconcile cascade routes its full SESSION arm to
// mirror the daemon's store-role split (CityRuntime.buildDesiredState /
// controlDispatcherTick): the leading store of buildDesiredStateWithSessionBeads,
// loadSessionBeadSnapshot, syncSessionBeadsWithSnapshotAndRigStores, and
// reconcileSessionBeadsAtPathWithNamedDemand all take the session-class store via
// cliSessionStore/cliSessionFrontDoor, with rigStores as the per-rig WORK tail. The
// one residual — releaseOrphanedPoolAssignmentsWhenSnapshotsComplete's
// liveOpenSessionAssignmentExists session read — stays on the plain store exactly as
// the daemon leaves it on cityBeadStore(), a shared work-release-boundary follow-up,
// not a cmd_start gap. The positive cliSessionStore( tripwire protects the routed
// arm; no unrouted sessionFrontDoor(store...) needle is carried. As a non-front-door
// router (its session reads go through store args, not front-door construction) this
// guard is a regression canary for the file, not a completeness proof — the
// end-to-end relocation acceptance test remains authoritative.
//
// cmd_sling.go routes its sling-nudge session access (doSlingNudge session
// lookups, deliverSlingNudge's observe/handle/last-nudge stamp via
// cliSessionStore/cliSessionFrontDoor derived from the target's cfg+cityPath, and
// printNudgePreview) while the queued-nudge enqueue stays on the plain store
// (nudges class, its own E1.2 routing). TWO sling-root session sites remain
// DEFERRED because their store is threaded cross-package and cannot be routed at
// the CLI root: (a) cliDirectSessionResolver (populateSlingDepsCallbacks →
// internal/sling → internal/graphroute → resolveSessionIDMaterializingNamed)
// materializes session beads on the WORK source store and needs a two-store
// SlingDeps/graphroute.Deps split (a session-class store added to the deps); and
// (b) the resolveGraphStepBinding* helpers DEFINED here read session state on a
// store supplied by their cmd_convoy_dispatch.go caller (never called from a sling
// root), owned by that caller's effort. So the positive cliSessionStore( tripwire
// protects the routed sling-nudge arm but NOT those two deferred cross-package
// sites — consistent with this guard being a regression canary, not a completeness
// proof.
//
// cmd_handoff.go routes its full SESSION arm — restartability
// (sessionRestartableByController), restart-request clear (clearRestartRequest ->
// sessionFrontDoor(sessStore).ApplyPatch), restart persist (sessionRestartPersister),
// the remote kill/observe/identity trio, resolveSessionID, sender-identity resolution
// (resolveDefaultMailSenderForCommand), and beadmail's session addressing via
// beadmail.NewWithStores(msgStore, sessStore) — through cliSessionStore. Its messaging
// arm is routed too: both roots derive msgStore via cliMailStore, mirroring
// newCityMailProvider's split. cmd_runtime_drain.go routes only
// cmdRuntimeRequestRestart's session-bead access; every other command in the file is
// drainOps runtime metadata (no bead store) plus nil-store worker observation, so the
// guard is a regression canary for that one root.
//
// cmd_wait.go additionally hosts the controller-shared wait machinery, so its
// session-class store params are named sessStore (making sessionFrontDoor(sessStore)
// and sessionFrontDoor(sessStore.Store) the sanctioned in-file forms). Its four CLI
// roots — cmdSessionWait, cmdWaitSetStateResult, doWaitListFallback,
// doWaitInspectFallback — derive sessStore := cliSessionStore(store, cfg, cityPath)
// and route the SESSION/wait bead access (wait-bead CRUD, session-bead lookups,
// wait_hold clears, cap-diagnostic stamps) through it, while dependency-bead reads
// (loadWaitDependencyBead, injected into doSessionWait's waitDependencyReader)
// deliberately stay on the plain WORK store (dep beads are work class, federated
// across rig scopes), and wait-nudge shadow lookups ride a NudgesStore over the same
// work store (nudges class,
// its own E1.2 routing). The positive cliSessionStore( tripwire protects the routed
// arm; as a non-front-door router (most session reads go through store args) this
// guard is a regression canary for the file, not a completeness proof — the
// end-to-end relocation acceptance test remains authoritative.
//
// cmd_nudge.go routes its delivery-tree SESSION arm via a two-store split derived
// from the nudge target's cfg+cityPath (the deliverSlingNudge precedent): the raw
// openNudgeBeadStore store keeps threading the nudge-queue currency, while each
// delivery helper derives sessStore := cliSessionStore(store, target.cfg,
// target.cityPath) and routes the session-class ops — worker observe/handle
// (nudgeObserveTarget / workerObserveNudgeTarget / workerHandleForNudgeTarget), the
// managed wake (session.WakeSession via requestManagedNudgeWake), named-session
// materialization (resolveSessionIDMaterializingNamed) and its Get, the last-nudge
// stamp (sessionFrontDoor(sessStore/deliverySessStore)), and the wait-bead reads in
// splitQueuedNudgesForDelivery — through it. tryDeliverQueuedNudgesByPoller and
// dispatchAllQueuedNudges take an explicit sessStore param that the CALLER resolves:
// the controller threads cr.sessionsBeadStore().Store, whose fallback is the WORK
// store (NOT the nudges store) — this closed the live controller-dispatcher class-mix
// where the session store was derived from cr.nudgesBeadStore().Store. The CLI
// poll/drain paths derive sessStore from their openNudgeBeadStore base, which is
// identity to the work store today (nil cfg) but is nudges-class-routed; a tracked
// E1.2 follow-up must thread a genuine work store there once openNudgeBeadStore
// relocates, or the CLI-path sessions fallback would re-land on the nudge DB.
// deliveryStore stays the nudges store for the queue record/dead-letter. The nudge-queue roots deliberately
// stay on openNudgeBeadStore — enqueue/ack/release/record/terminalize/rollback and
// nudgeFrontDoor are nudges class (their own E1.2 routing), mirroring cmd_sling.go's
// deferred nudge enqueue. nudge_dispatcher.go is a pure RECEIVER of that session store
// (routed at the controller boundary in city_runtime.go, a mixed file off this list),
// so it is intentionally absent from the routed-files list. The positive cliSessionStore(
// tripwire protects the routed delivery arm; as a non-front-door router this guard is
// a regression canary for the file, not a completeness proof.
//
// cmd_mail.go routes at its store-opening ROOTS rather than per-read, because every
// store access in its identity/target resolver family is session-class: session-ID
// resolution, the gc:session enumeration behind named-target matching, and mailbox
// identity. The five roots — resolveMailTargetsForCommand,
// resolveDefaultMailTargetsForCommand, resolveRawMailTargetForStorelessProvider,
// cmdMailSendJSON, cmdMailReplyJSON — derive cliSessionStore(store, cfg, cityPath) and
// hand it down; the whole resolver family therefore names its parameter sessStore and
// does NO routing of its own, so a relocation is applied exactly once per command.
// Mail MESSAGES are a different coordination class and never travel through these
// resolvers — they go through mail.Provider. The two out-of-file callers
// (cmd_handoff.go, prime_auto_handoff_inject.go) already hold a routed sessStore.
