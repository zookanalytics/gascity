// `gc hook --claim` first spends up to hookWorkQueryTimeout finding routed work —
// a loaded multi-rig city's federated probe legitimately runs tens of seconds —
// and only then reaches the claim CAS, which needs up to hookClaimMutationTimeout.
// A flat 45s window anchored at invocation start charged that read latency
// against the claim, so raising hookWorkQueryTimeout was inert on the --claim
// path: the query now succeeds at ~t=70s but the fence refused the claim at 45s,
// relocating the starvation from session.work_query_failed to
// execution.claim_window_expired. Summing the two budgets keeps the turn-binding
// intent — a claim reaching the CAS later than an honest full-budget
// query-plus-mutation could is treated as orphaned — while giving a genuinely
// slow-but-alive read the headroom to claim the work the raise now surfaces.
//
// Ceilings: a provider CALLBACK lane is refused earlier by hookClaimNonTurnMarker
// and never reaches this window, so the 15s callback budget is not the bound here;
// the bound is the DIRECT turn's patience, which the hookWorkQueryTimeout raise
// already assumes is at least this budget. The window can now exceed
// idleClaimNudgeGrace (90s); in the measured worst case (~70s) the claim still

// session with no worktree still needs its back-reference — but never on control
// beads, which stay session-free by graphroute's design
// (ApplyGraphControlRouteBinding), even when a control-dispatcher session claims one
// through this same hook path.
//
// It also carries gc.work_dir, but only for a bead that records no checkout under

// case where the bead has named no workspace for the branch to come from. A bead
// that records a checkout keeps it, even an unusable one, because overwriting the
// canonical key while the legacy key disagrees is a state worktreeSpecForBead
// refuses outright.

// WRITE-ONCE, stamped only when absent from the bead's current metadata and never
// touched again. A naive claimed_at = now() would differ from
// the stored value on every tick by construction and defeat the compare-and-skip
// protection the rest of this function relies on (see stampHookClaimIdentity's doc
// comment on the flood-class risk). It is also unconditional across control and
