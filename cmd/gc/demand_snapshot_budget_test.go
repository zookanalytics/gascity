// The demand snapshot's read budget.
//
// load_demand_snapshot was 24.2s of a 373s maintainer-city tick, and two of its
// three costs were reads of the remote work ledger that the operator invariant
// says do not belong on the runtime plane at all (ga-l7jdg, bd memory
// gascity-runtime-infra-store-invariant):
//
//   - the CACHE CHECK itself. readyDemandSnapshotFingerprint issued one ReadyLive
//     per store — city ledger, sessions binding, every rig — so asking "may I
//     reuse the snapshot?" cost more remote round trips than most legs.
//   - collect_unassigned_routed, 8.1s: one live open-list per census leg,
//     SEQUENTIALLY, for work the operator ruling says lives only in the graph
//     store ("gc ready work will never be in the work db").
//
// The third, collect_assigned_work, deliberately keeps its ledger leg: a session
// whose only claim is an HQ work bead must stay visible to the census or the
// drain gate reaps a live holder (ga-w8ucu). Latency is not a reason to go blind
// about who holds what.
