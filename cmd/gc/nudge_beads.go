// per-tick poll helpers close every store they open. Tests that replace this
// package variable must stay serial; do not use t.Parallel in those tests.
// It routes the opened work store through resolveNudgesStore and returns the
// strongly-typed beads.NudgesStore so the nudges class is statically visible to
// every leaf nudge-bead helper; the wrapper carries the same underlying store
// value (identity to the work store until the nudges class relocates).
//
// It discards the opened handle, so a caller of this form can never close the
// work store the call opened. Once the nudges class relocates, that work store
// is not the store returned, so it stays open (leaks) for the life of the
// process; only on an unrelocated city is the returned store the opened handle.
// A frame that closes what it opened must use openOwnedNudgeBeadStore and close
// the returned handle, never the class store: closing the class store on a
// relocated city is the bug openOwnedNudgeBeadStore exists to prevent.

// openOwnedNudgeBeadStore is the owning-frame form of openNudgeBeadStore: it
// returns the nudges-class store to use AND the handle this call opened, which
// is the only handle the caller may close.
//
// The two differ exactly when the NUDGES class is relocated onto a storage
// binding. resolveNudgesStore then discards the work store this call opened and
// returns the storage routes' process-shared engine, which the routes own and
// closeCLIStorageRoutes releases when the invocation ends. A frame that closes
// "the store it holds" therefore closes the routes' engine without detaching
// their memo, and the memo goes on serving a closed engine: every later class
// read in the process — nudge delivery itself, and the controller's own socket
// handlers — then fails with ErrStoreClosed until the process exits.
//
// Closing by "the handle I opened" is also what keeps the ownership answer in
// one place. The alternative, asking the routes a second time whether this class
// is relocated, is the re-derivation the residency contract reserves to the
// resolver, and is how this bug class reproduces
// (scripts/residency-boundary-patterns.txt, rule b).
//

// counting fake replaces: openNudgeBeadStore delegates here, so a test that
// substitutes this var moves both forms at once and the two can never disagree.

// cause at all — the operator could not tell a missing city from a locked
