# Dashboard

The dashboard is a web UI compiled into the `gc` binary for monitoring
convoys, agents, mail, rigs, sessions, and events in real time.

## Prerequisites

The dashboard is a separate web server. It needs a GC API server to talk to,
and `gc dashboard serve` still must be run from inside a city directory so it
can resolve local command context.

### Standalone city mode

If you are using `gc start` without the machine-wide supervisor, the dashboard
talks to that city's own API server. Ensure the city API is enabled in
`city.toml`:

```toml
[api]
port = 9443
```

Then start the city normally with `gc start`. The API server starts with the
controller on that port.

### Supervisor mode

If you are using the machine-wide supervisor, the dashboard talks to the
supervisor API instead. The default supervisor API address is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8372
```

In this mode, per-city `[api]` ports are ignored. The dashboard detects
supervisor mode automatically via `cities.list`, enables a city selector, and
sends city-scoped requests over the shared WebSocket protocol.

## Starting the dashboard

```
gc dashboard                               # Auto-discover API from current city
gc dashboard --port 3000                  # Same, custom dashboard port
gc dashboard serve                        # Explicit subcommand; same discovery
gc dashboard --api http://127.0.0.1:8372 # Optional override
```

When run inside a city, `gc dashboard` auto-discovers the right API server:

- Supervisor-managed city: uses the machine supervisor API and defaults the UI
  to the current city scope.
- Standalone `gc start --foreground`: uses that city's configured `[api]`
  listener directly.

The `--api` flag remains available as an override for non-standard setups.

## Features

The dashboard provides:

- **Convoys** — progress tracking, tracked issues, create new convoys
- **Crew** — named worker status with activity detection
- **Polecats** — ephemeral worker activity and work status
- **Activity timeline** — categorized event feed with filters
- **Mail** — inbox with threading, compose, and all-traffic view
- **Merge queue** — open PRs with CI and mergeable status
- **Escalations** — priority-colored escalation list
- **Ready work** — items available for assignment
- **Health** — system heartbeat and agent counts
- **Issues** — backlog with priority, age, labels, assignment
- **Command palette** (Cmd+K) — execute gc commands from the browser

Real-time updates use WebSocket subscriptions from the browser directly to the
GC API server. The dashboard server only serves static assets plus bootstrap
configuration; it does not proxy API or event traffic.
