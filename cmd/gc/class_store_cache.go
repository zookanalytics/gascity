// The controller's CachingStore over a split city's relocated class binding.
//
// A split city serves graph, sessions, messaging, orders and nudges from one
// binding engine that storage boot opens (openStorageRoutes). The work and rig
// ledgers have always sat under a CachingStore in the controller; the binding
// sat bare. So every class read on a split city was a live engine read, the
// controller's own writes to the binding appended no bead.* event, and the
// sessions leg had no census or watermark (CacheRevision, WriteRev) at all.
// withControllerCache gives the binding the same layer the work ledger has.
//
// # Layering: the cache sits directly on the engine, and it is the emitter
//
// The one-shot CLI emits through emittingClassStore (class_store_emit.go). The
// controller must not: its CachingStore already records every write-through
// mutation, and a second emitter on the same write is a double row. The cache
// is also the one layer that can see a bead engine's ready projection, which it
// finds by type-asserting its backing, so any wrapper between the two turns the
// projection off. Cache over engine, emitting through the cache's own onChange,
// satisfies both. The rows carry the cache actors (cache-local for a write,
// cache-reconcile for what a scan infers), the ones the work ledger's cache
// stamps on the identical write on a city that relocates nothing, so a split
// city's events poke, enqueue and fold exactly as a single-store city's do.
//
// # Freshness
//
// A read that asks for live (HandlesFor(store).Live, ListQuery.Live,
// beads.ReadyLive) still reads the engine. The legacy demand reads that exist
// for cross-process freshness are all spelled that way, so they are unchanged.
// A cached read sees:
//   - this process's writes immediately (write-through);
//   - a one-shot CLI write when the bead-event watcher delivers the event it
//     emitted (applyBeadEventToStores routes every namespace the binding serves
//     here);
//   - a write that emitted nothing (a Tx-shaped CLI write, a failed best-effort
//     emission, a raw bd write to a workspace binding) at the cache's next
//     re-scan: at most the adaptive cadence (30/60/120s by active-row count)
//     plus one 5s poll.
//
// Those are the bounds a single-store city's cached class reads already live
// with, minus the gap bd's missing hooks leave there. A poked tick still loads
// its session snapshot live (loadTickSessionBeadSnapshot).
//
// One known limit: a relic — a bead `gc storage migrate` carried into the
// binding under its original work-ledger id — refreshes only at the re-scan.
// Its events route by prefix to the work store, and the work ledger keeps a
// frozen same-id copy of it, so applying those events to the binding as well
// would let the two caches trade the copy and the row back and forth forever.
// Relics are rarely written; the re-scan bound (above) is theirs.
//
// # Lifecycle
//
// Wrapped once, at controller-state construction and before any lane runs, so
// nothing has read the routes concurrently yet. The routes are immutable for
// the process (a [storage] change requires a restart), so a config reload does
// NOT rebuild this cache: its epoch is the process's, while the work and rig
// caches take a new epoch per reload. Priming and the reconcile loop are the
// work ledger's (wrapWithCachingStore). routes.close stops the loop before the
// engine closes.
