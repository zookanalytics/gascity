// The rig arm of the control-class split.
//
// TestControlDispatchRigScopeStaysOnItsOwnStore pins the other half: a rig scope
// keeps its own store, because `gc storage migrate` copies only the CITY work
// store, so a rig has no frozen retained copies to be misled by. That reasoning
// is sound and unchanged. What it did not cover is that a rig dispatcher's
// control beads are not all rig-resident in the first place.
//
// A workflow materializes its control beads into the ledger that owns the
// graph class, and the class binding is CITY-keyed — one per city, regardless
// of which rig's dispatcher the beads are then routed to. So a rig dispatcher's
// queue is split across two ledgers: the beads its own workflows minted in the
// rig store, and the beads a city-scoped molecule minted in the binding and
// routed to it. Measured on a live city: 148 open control beads carrying
// gc.routed_to=<rig>/core.control-dispatcher sat in the binding while the
// dispatcher's every readiness scan asked only the rig store and got `[]` —
// exit 0, empty array, "no work", forever.
//
// The two sets have DISJOINT ids, which is what makes a union safe rather than
// ambiguous: the rig store was never a migration target, so no id is co-resident
// and no leg can shadow a live copy with a stale one. Verified on the same live
// city — all 20 graph-class control beads carrying the rig's own id prefix were
// absent from the rig store.
//
// The scope store stays the FIRST leg, so every id it holds resolves exactly
// where it resolves today and the rig dispatchers already draining their own
// ledgers are untouched.

// rigFederationFixture stands up a split city with a rig scope, a fake `bd` on
// PATH answering for the rig leg, and a memory-backed city graph binding.
//
// The fake bd is what makes the scope leg observable: the shell arm of the
// fallback reads through it, so a bead in its payload can only have come from
// the scope leg, and a bead in the binding can only have come from the graph
// leg. Without that separation a union test cannot tell a merged answer from a
// single leg that happened to hold both.
//
// GC_CITY is set because that is how a rig-scoped dispatcher actually finds its
// city. tryControlReadyFromCacheOrFallback derives the city from the scope dir
// via cityForStoreDir, which prefers the env over walking up the filesystem —
// and it has to: rigs are routinely OUTSIDE the city tree (on the live city,
// GC_DIR=/data/projects/beads under GC_CITY=/data/projects/maintainer-city), so
// filesystem discovery from the rig dir would find no city at all and the whole
// federation would silently not apply. The .gc marker is what makes the env
// value pass validateCityPath.
