// The route-recovery lane: events for freshness, a cadenced scan for convergence.
//
// # What was wrong
//
// restoreCarriedWorkRoutes is a CONVERGENCE backstop — it repairs a route that a
// mid-write crash, a legacy import or a claim/release flip lost — and it was
// wired to run at DELTA cadence: a full live open-corpus scan of the city work
// ledger and every rig, on every controller tick. On maintainer-city, whose work
// ledger answers from remote postgres at ~5.4s per query, that single leg was
// 185.3s +/- 0.7s of a ~360s tick (ga-l7jdg, measured on ga-4qdfn). The variance
// under 0.4% is the tell: a fixed-size scan of a corpus that does not change.
//
// The read-only discriminator on mc (ga-l7jdg S1 step 1) says which of the three
// decompositions it is: across 16h of controller journal there is not one
// `route recovery (...): restored gc.routed_to on N ready bead(s)` line, and the
// ledger's open corpus carries gc.run_target on ZERO beads. So there is no
// re-stamp flap to fix in a sibling lane and no per-candidate Get fan-out — the
// whole leg is the scan itself, paid every tick to discover nothing.
//
// # The split
//
// This is the CachingStore doctrine (internal/beads/caching_store_reconcile.go)
// promoted from the store layer to the tick's leg vocabulary: events are
// freshness, a rare authoritative scan is convergence.
//
//   - The DELTA pass runs in the tick. Its candidates are the beads named by
//     bead.created / bead.updated since the lane's journal cursor, and nothing
//     else. A steady tick names nothing and therefore reads nothing: it does not
//     even build a plan.
//   - The BACKSTOP pass is the old full scan, unchanged in what it repairs,
//     demoted to a background lane on an hourly cadence — plus, immediately, on
//     every way the event feed can lie: startup, a cursor gap, a watcher that
//     could not start or restarted, a candidate queue overflow, and a leg that
//     errored on the previous pass.
//
// Events CAN be lost — an agent's bd write reaches the journal through a hook
// chain that can be killed, and a graph store emits no bead.closed at all — so
// the backstop is not optional and its "events lost, backstop heals" behavior is
// pinned by its own control test.
//
// # Two ways a repair waits for the backstop, and they are not the same way
//
// The obvious one is an EVENT-LESS loss: nothing ever named the bead, so the
// delta lane cannot know it exists and only a scan finds it.
//
// The second is DELIVERED-BUT-OFF-PLANE, and it is a product of the operator
// invariant rather than of any failure. The journal names a bead, the event
// arrives, the lane accepts it as a candidate — and the bead lives on a leg the
// runtime plane refuses to read (the work ledger, a rig). The tick resolves
// nothing for it and it waits for the convergence lane exactly as an event-less
// loss does. Nothing is broken; the two just have different causes and different
// remedies, and only one of them is a routing question. The delta report counts
// them as `dropped` so a rising count is visible instead of silent. The counter
// is a superset by construction: a candidate claimed or closed since its event
// also fails to resolve, also waits for the backstop, and telling those apart
// would mean reading the leg this plane exists to refuse.
//
// # Two things the old scanner could not say
//
// A candidate whose live re-check keeps failing used to be re-read forever in
// silence. It is now QUARANTINED after two consecutive backstop passes: a
// metadata marker the `route-recovery-quarantine` doctor check surfaces, cleared
// automatically the moment the re-check passes, and liftable with
// `gc doctor --fix`. It is a label, never a skip — the bead stays a candidate.
//
// A bead whose restore SUCCEEDS every pass is the opposite failure: some sibling
// lane is clearing gc.routed_to behind us, and a faster treadmill is not a fix.
// Re-stamps per bead are bounded; past the bound the lane stops writing, says so
// loudly, and quarantines the bead for the operator.

// # Which legs each plane gets, and why the split is here rather than in Plan()

// The runtime plane reads the class bindings and nothing else — the operator
// invariant above. A city that relocates no class has no binding, and there its
// work store IS its infra store, so the plan's work leg is the runtime leg: the
// rule degrades to "the only store there is" rather than to "no store at all",
// which would silently disable the delta lane on every single-store city.
//
// The reconcile plane is NOT the mirror image — it reads every leg, binding
// included. It is a convergence contract rather than a latency one, and a store
// it skips is a store nothing converges: the runtime plane over that same
// binding is delta-only, so one dropped journal event would strand a
// binding-resident bead permanently.
//
// # What reading the binding means for a workflow root
//
// carriedPoolRoute's legacy arm restores gc.routed_to on a gc.kind=workflow root
// whose gc.run_target is set and gc.routed_to empty — the pre-ga-eld2x relic
// shape, and the graph binding is where those roots live. That is not a new
// hazard, it is the same repair `gc doctor --fix`'s run-target-routed-to-backfill
// already performs there, and it is the operator ruling's whole point: routed
// work lives ONLY in the graph store, so the binding is where a lost route can
// be lost. The re-stamp-a-blocked-root failure (gc-4zb) is guarded where it
// always was — the Live raw-status filter on the open read, not by which store
// is asked.
//
// Expressing the invariant as a leg filter here, rather than as a new intent in
// internal/storeref, is deliberate. Plan(RoutedWork) orders the binding LAST on
// purpose (#5148 co-residence), and a runtime-plane intent that structurally
// refuses ledger legs is the resolver's own relevance-descriptor work — the S4

// Get fan-out collapsed — one IN-list read per leg instead of one Get per bead.
// Every guard it carried is preserved and separately pinned:
//
//   - Live on the open List is what makes Status:"open" mean open (gc-4zb).
//     mapBdStatus folds bd's blocked/deferred/review/testing into "open", so a
//     blocked bead is indistinguishable from ready work in every beads.Bead this
//     code can read; only the backing store's raw --status=open filter excludes
//     it, and only a Live query reaches that filter.
//   - The re-verify reads through the store's authoritative, cache-bypassing
//     handle, because a plain read can return a cached bead that predates a
//     cross-process claim (ga-bgu). A claim flips the bead to in_progress and
//     consumes gc.routed_to in one update (ga-sa0); re-stamping over it hands the
//     dispatcher a phantom pool-demand bead that flaps.
//   - The write is keyed on the LIVE row's own carried route, so a bead another
//     pass already restored yields "" and the pass stays idempotent.
//
// The window between the re-verify and the write is narrowed, not closed. The
// re-stamp stays monotonic (never worse than the prior blind write), so the
// residual degrades to the pre-guard behavior rather than a new failure.
