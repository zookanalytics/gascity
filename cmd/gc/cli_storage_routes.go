// One-shot CLI storage routing: the same binding the controller serves, or a
// store that refuses.
//
// storage_boot.go decides where a long-running controller serves each
// coordination class from. This file decides it for the other half of the
// program — `gc mail`, `gc nudge`, `gc sling`, `gc formula`, `gc prime`, the
// control dispatcher's one-shot arm — which open the work store themselves and
// never build a CityRuntime.
//
// Both tiers take the same verdict from the same gate, and that is the whole
// content of this file. A one-shot command reading the work store while the
// controller reads the binding is two ledgers for one city, and every symptom of
// it — mail sent and never delivered, a nudge queued into a store nothing polls,
// a graph the CLI cannot see — looks like a bug in the feature rather than in
// the routing.
//
// # Once per process
//
// The gate resolves a plan and opens a database. A one-shot command touches
// several class resolvers, so the resolution is memoized per city and the open
// happens at most once, whichever call site arrives first. The routes are closed
// where the process ends (main.go), which is the only place that knows the last
// call site has run.
//
// # It resolves the config itself
//
// The call sites disagree about what config they hold: some pass the city config
// their command loaded, one passes nil because it only ever had a path, and two
// pass whatever a load that ignores its own error returned. Where a city serves
// its coordination classes from is a property of the CITY, not of the caller's
// snapshot, so this file reads city.toml once and answers from that — otherwise
// the store a migrated city serves would depend on which call site got there
// first.
//
// # A refused city gets a store that refuses
//
// The verdict is three-valued exactly as it is at boot: serve, bypass, or
// refuse. What differs is how a refusal is DELIVERED, and the two obvious ways
// are both closed. A class resolver has no error to return — sixty-odd call
// sites could not carry one — and terminating the process is not this program's
// to do: the invocation lifecycle must keep control until run returns, which
// TestProductMetricsExitBypassCensus enforces against exactly four reviewed
// sites.
//
// So the refusal is delivered as the store. The five infrastructure classes
// route at refusedClassStore, whose every operation returns the boot refusal —
// the same sentence, from the same function, naming the same command — and the
// reason is printed once when the verdict is taken, so an operator sees it even
// on a path that discards the store error. Work is untouched: it stays on the
// work ledger, where a refused city's work still belongs.
//
// What this must never be is the work store. That is the answer that looks like
// success and reads the ledger the relocated class was moved off, and it is the
// defect this file exists to close.
//
// The command the refusal names is exempt, and structurally rather than by a
// carve-out: `gc storage migrate` and `gc storage status` resolve their own
// target and read it directly (cmd_storage.go), so they reach no class resolver
// and enter nothing here. That is what keeps the remedy runnable on exactly the
// city the refusal is about, and TestStorageStatusStaysOffTheOneShotFunnel
// fails if either one ever starts routing through a class instead.
