// $REFINERY_TARGET resolved empty), the bead is left open+unassigned+unrouted
// with a branch already on origin — invisible to both the pool demand probe
// (which keys on gc.routed_to) and releaseOrphanedPoolAssignments (which only
// processes assigned work). This sweep finds such beads via gc.session_name →
// session bead → template and re-stamps gc.routed_to, returning each bead to
// pool demand. Returns the count of restored beads.
//
// Recovery is judgment-free (ZFC): it reads the original pool route from the
// session bead's own template metadata and re-stamps gc.routed_to. The bead
// re-enters pool demand; the formula re-evaluates it from there. No role names

// claimed bead — including molecule steps and plain claimed beads that push
// nothing. gc.step_id / gc.step_ref exclude those steps outright: a molecule
// step is advanced by its formula chain, never by route recovery, so restoring
// a route on a parked step only re-offers a dead chain to the pool.
