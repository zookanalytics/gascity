// The tick's read budget, as a golden table.
//
// A controller tick's latency is not a wall-clock property of this machine; it
// is the number of SEQUENTIAL store round trips the tick makes, multiplied by
// whatever the slowest leg's RTT happens to be. On maintainer-city the work
// ledger is remote postgres at ~5.4s per query, and that multiplication is the
// whole incident: the detached-orphan sweep's per-store open scan was 180.8s of
// a 373s tick, the completions walk 69.7s on top, and the route-recovery scan was
// blamed for another 185s before the trace showed it had been the orphan sweep
// all along (ga-l7jdg, ga-4qdfn).
//
// So the regression gate counts round trips. A leg that quietly goes back to
// scanning per tick fails here as a deterministic integer diff — not as a flaky
// timing assertion on a loaded CI box. The latency injector below exists only so
// the wall-clock half can be stated as narrative: at a stand-in RTT, this many
// round trips is this many seconds.
//
// The remaining two hot legs carry their budgets in their own files, because
// theirs are not zero and their fixtures are whole subsystems: order dispatch in
// order_gate_budget_test.go (gate reads scale with STORES, not orders; zero
// ledger round trips) and the demand snapshot in demand_snapshot_budget_test.go
// (zero ledger round trips in the cache check and the routed-demand read). Same
// gate, same unit, three files.

// tickRTT is the stand-in for the remote ledger's per-query latency —
// maintainer-city's work store answers in ~5.4s, scaled down to keep the
// arithmetic readable.
//
// It is MODELED, not slept. The gate is the deterministic round-trip count; a
// real sleep would buy nothing but wall-clock the test does not assert on, would
// make the suite slower for every future run, and would put a fixed sleep in the
// test-resource census for no coverage. The elapsed figure below is the count
// times the RTT, which is exactly what a real sleep would have produced.
