//     attached to it. A claimed stepless root is held by a live worker; an

//     autocloseMoleculeIfComplete skips stepless roots outright — it has no TTL
//     to bound the instantiator race with, and this sweep does.)
//  3. Exempt: skip roots carrying the gc.gc_exempt marker. This is a generic,
//     operator-supplied opt-out — the SDK never stamps it (stamping a specific
//     named root would hardcode a deployment role). A deployment marks any
//     long-lived root it never wants auto-closed; the guard is a no-op until it
//     does, which is safe under the dry-run default.

//     unboundedly — one per restart cycle, invisible to the assignee-and-status
//     filtered queries meant to reconcile them (gastownhall/gascity ga-98b).

//     here; only the claim status can, and this one is no longer unclaimed.

// (isAbandonedRootCandidate), and a deployment can park a perpetual root-only
