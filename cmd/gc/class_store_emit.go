package main

// bead.* emission for the one-shot CLI's relocated coordination classes.
//
// A split city serves graph, sessions, messaging, orders and nudges from a
// binding the controller opens at boot and one-shot commands open through the
// funnel (cli_storage_routes.go). The controller's copy of the city's work
// ledger sits under a CachingStore, whose notifyChange appends a bead.* row to
// <city>/.gc/events.jsonl after every mutation. The binding has no such layer
// on either side, so every write a one-shot command made to a relocated class —
// `gc bd close` of a gcg- step, `gc sling`, `gc formula cook`, the control
// dispatcher's one-shot arm, mail, nudges — landed in the store and appended
// nothing.
//
// What that costs is not the events: it is every consumer that reconstructs
// state by folding them. The event-sourced run projection never saw a
// worker-side close, so a molecule's steps rendered "Running" forever and the
// wisp reap made it permanent by deleting the rows the fold would have needed
// to recover from. The event-delta lanes read the same journal from a cursor,
// so on a split city they read an empty delta and conclude nothing happened.
//
// # One target, injected once
//
// Emission is not a property of a store; it is a property of the PROCESS that
// opened it. The controller has a live event bus and its own emitter, and a
// second one on the same mutation is a double row in the log — worse on the
// reconcile path, where the cache re-absorbs rows in bulk and a per-row emitter
// turns absorption into a flood.
//
// So the emit target is set on the ROUTES, at the one construction that belongs
// to a one-shot command (resolveCLIStorageRoutes), and never at the one that
// belongs to the controller (openStorageRoutes). The controller path is
// therefore untouched by construction rather than by a runtime test that could
// answer wrongly: it never reaches this file at all.
// TestClassStoreEmitTargetHasExactlyOneInjectionSite pins the single injector,
// because "the controller does not emit" is a claim about the call graph and
// nothing else keeps a second injector from appearing.
//
// # Why the wrapper forwards so much
//
// A relocated class store is a bare bead engine: openStorageRoutes hands back
// whatever the binding's provider opened (a *beads.SQLiteStore for the built-in
// binding, a *beads.NativeDoltStore for a workspace one) with no wrapper of any
// kind. Emission therefore has to arrive as one, and a wrapper is exactly how
// this repo loses capabilities: the optional interfaces are discovered by type
// assertion, so a method the wrapper does not carry does not fail — the caller
// simply stops matching and takes a slower or weaker path, silently. Every
// method either engine declares is forwarded here, and
// TestEmittingClassStoreKeepsEveryEngineCapability fails if either grows one
// this file does not.
//
// # What it emits, and what it deliberately does not
//
// The payload is the canonical bead snapshot from
// beads.EncodeBeadEventPayload, decodable by beads.DecodeBeadEventPayload and
// foldable by the run projection, with the run/session/step correlation
// resolved onto the typed envelope from the same metadata keys and through the
// same helpers. bead.closed rides only a genuine open→closed transition, because
// the export boundary drops bead.updated and a metadata write to a closed bead
// that rode bead.closed would re-close it in every replay.
//
// Tx is NOT shadowed. A transaction's effect is whatever its body did, and this
// layer cannot know which beads changed without re-reading the store around
// every call — so a Tx-shaped write on a relocated class stays event-dark, as it
// was before this file. That is a known gap rather than an oversight; closing it
// needs a touched-id set from the Tx itself.
//
// Emission is best-effort, per the one-shot recorder precedent: the mutation has
// already committed when the row is written, so a journal that cannot be opened
// must not turn a landed close into a failed command. Failures are surfaced once
// per process through classStoreEmitWarn rather than swallowed, because a
// dropped terminal event that nobody hears about is the failure this file
// exists to end.
