// drain probes are WORK queries (List{Assignee,Status,...} / ReadyLive) that
// happen to be keyed by a session's assignment identifiers; left raw they reach
// the WORK store *through* the session store. Routing them through this façade
// makes the WORK store the explicit source.
//
// The façade carries a beads.WorkStore (the work class), but every optional
// capability (CachedList, ReadyLive's Backing()) is asserted on the embedded
// .Store, never the wrapper — wrapping a Store in WorkStore does NOT promote
// optional capabilities, and asserting on the wrapper would silently drop the
// cache/live fast-paths (the typed-nil trap, OBJECT-MODEL-FRONT-DOOR-DESIGN.md
// invariant 3/4). On a single-store city the work store IS the same object the
// session arm uses, so the bead reads emitted here are byte-identical to the
