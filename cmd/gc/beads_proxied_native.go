// admission may spend and what they mean, what environment the linked library is
// opened with, what happens when a read's reconnect finds the proxy replaced,

//
//   - gc never spawns dolt and never starts a proxy. The only lifecycle moves
//     available are the two provider verbs below, both of which ask BD to make
//     bd's proxy healthy.
//   - nothing here runs unless the persisted topology is proxied-server, the
//     rollout flag is on, and the factory decided to consult the opener. The
//     openers are built unconditionally at every composition root; they are inert
//     until all three hold.

// lacks dolt_database but whose config validates gets the GUESSED name "beads",
// and admission pins and probes it. Only a total resolution failure — the error
// return — yields "".
//
// The guess is fenced rather than harmless, which is why this is a comment fix

// database is caught by proxiedPrefixAgreement with both handles open. And

// ResolveScopeConfigState to return ScopeConfigAuthoritative — which means the
