// A per-bead worktree is protected from reaping when a process is actively
// working inside it, even though its bead is closed and its tree is momentarily
// git-clean. This is the "closed-bead != end-of-use" guard: bead status and
// git-cleanliness say nothing about whether an agent is mid-stage in the tree
// right now (a source anchor closes at plan-delivery while later review stages
// keep committing in the same tree; a tree is transiently clean between a push
// and the next stage). Deleting such a tree destroys live work — the founding
// incident behind gastownhall/gascity#4492.
//
// The design is modeled on the dolt_cleanup fail-closed precedent
// (dolt_cleanup_discovery.go): the /proc/<pid>/cwd signal is authoritative, and
// when it cannot be gathered the caller must protect every worktree rather than
// risk deleting live work.

// liveWorktreeState captures the working directories of every live process the
// reaper could observe on this host, plus whether the enumeration itself
// succeeded.
type liveWorktreeState struct {
	// cwds is the set of canonicalized (symlink-resolved, absolute) working
	// directories of live processes. Deduplicated.
	cwds []string
	// scanned reports whether the process table was enumerated at all. False
	// means liveness is indeterminate — no enumeration mechanism was available,
	// or every one of them failed — and the reaper must fail closed by
	// protecting every candidate worktree.
	scanned bool
	// source names the mechanism that produced this scan (liveScanSourceProc,
	// liveScanSourceLsof), empty when scanned is false. Recorded so the choice
	// of mechanism is observable rather than inferred from the host: a fallback
	// that silently substitutes itself is hard to debug when the gate later
	// behaves unexpectedly.

// collectLiveWorktreeStateFn is the seam the reaper calls to gather live
// process cwds. Indirected through a package-level var so tests can inject a
// deterministic set (including the fail-closed scanned=false case) without
// standing up real processes.
var collectLiveWorktreeStateFn = collectLiveWorktreeState

// collectLiveWorktreeState walks /proc/<pid>/cwd for every process on the host
// and records their canonical working directories. On a host without /proc it
// falls back to a portable process-table enumeration
// (bead_worktree_liveness_fallback.go); when no mechanism succeeds it returns
// scanned=false so the caller fails closed and reaps nothing.
//
// The fallback matters because /proc is Linux-only, and returning
// scanned=false for its absence does not merely make the reaper cautious on
// other platforms — it disables the feature outright and permanently, while the
// operator sees only "liveness scan unavailable". Darwin binaries are a
// published release target, and CI runs on Linux, so nothing here fails on the
// platform where the gate never worked.
//
// The check is at runtime rather than behind a build tag deliberately: /proc can
// also be absent on Linux (a container without it mounted), and the same
// fallback covers that case.
//
// Per-process readlink failures are skipped, not fatal: a process may exit
// mid-walk, and a process owned by another user may have a cwd this process
// cannot resolve. The fleet runs every agent as the same user, so agent
// worktree cwds are always visible here; the active-session-directory
// cross-check plus the git-clean and closed-bead gates back-stop any process
// this scan cannot see. This matches the dolt reaper's posture: the /proc
// signal protects, it never authorizes a deletion the other gates would refuse.
