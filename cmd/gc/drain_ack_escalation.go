package main

// The terminal exit for a drain-ack stop-pending seat whose agent left its TURN
// but not its RUNTIME.
//
// A drain-acked session is parked at `state=draining,
// state_reason=drain-ack-stop-pending` and its stop is queued asynchronously.
// When the agent acks correctly and then keeps sitting at its prompt, the
// runtime never dies, so `finalizeDrainAckStopPendingSessions` observes
// `obs.Running || obs.Alive` on every tick and re-queues the same stop forever.
// Seven live seats sat that way for two days, each holding a pool slot name, so
// buildDesiredState answered "pool session name unavailable" and the pool could
// not mint replacements.
//
// # Why re-issuing the ordinary stop cannot be the answer
//
// The pre-existing loop ALREADY kills every tick, and for a pane that answers
// the kill it already works: the runtime dies, the next tick observes it dead,
// and the existing terminus closes the bead and frees the name. So the rows that
// sit for days are, by construction, exactly the ones the ordinary kill does not
// terminate — and `worker.Handle.Kill` is not a stronger kill than `Stop`, it is
// `Stop` minus the bead write (both land on `runtime.Provider.Stop`). An
// escalation that re-sends the same signal is the same signal sent more times.
//
// The tmux Stop does walk the pane's process tree with SIGTERM then SIGKILL, but
// it discovers targets by topology (descendants of the pane, plus process-group
// members reparented to init) and it never re-checks liveness after its final
// KILL wave, so it returns success unconditionally. A process that has escaped
// that topology outlives it silently.
//
// So the escalation's added force is `runtime.ProcessTableScanner`: it finds
// live agent roots by their GC_SESSION_ID environment variable — independent of
// provider artifacts and immune to setsid/reparenting/PGID changes — and
// terminates by PID with process-group signaling, 5s/3s windows, start-time
// identity, and an error when death is NOT confirmed. That capability already
// exists in-tree; what did not exist is a route to it for a live, tracked,
// open-bead session. Both existing callers skip `IsTracked` runtimes by design,
// which is every session we are trying to rescue.
//
// # Bypassing the IsTracked guard safely
//
// That guard is load-bearing, and it was doing TWO jobs. Replacing it needs both.
//
// Session-level authorization: the bead must be in the drain-ack stop-pending
// wedge state, its drain bound must have elapsed, it must hold no assigned work,
// nobody may be attached and the pane must have been quiet, the runtime's
// GC_INSTANCE_TOKEN must still match the incarnation we parked, and the attempt
// must be durably paced.
//
// PER-PROCESS attribution, which is the half that is easy to miss: none of the
// above says WHICH process to signal. GC_SESSION_ID and GC_CITY_PATH are
// ordinary environment variables inherited by every child the agent ever
// spawned, and the scan promotes any of them to an "agent root" once it
// reparents to a subreaper — so matching on those two fields proves lineage, not
// ownership, and sweeps in every daemon an agent ever backgrounded. See
// drainAckForceTerminationTargets, which is where that fence lives.
//
// # What this pass does NOT do
//
// It does not close the bead. Closing is left to the finalizer's own
// `!obs.Running && !obs.Alive` arm on a later tick, which re-observes from
// scratch. Authorizing a close from inside the kill path was a real hazard:
// confirmDrainAckRuntimeDead reports true on a definite instance-token MISMATCH
// (meaning "someone else owns this name now", which is correct for "stop
// re-killing" and catastrophic for "close the bead"), and closing while a live
// pane holds the runtime name frees the bead without freeing the name, so the
// pool's next create fails the same way.
//
// # The identity set is the whole ballgame
//
// The assigned-work gate probes session.AssigneeIdentities, NOT the narrower
// config-aware set (sessionAssignmentIdentifiersForConfigInfo). That set honors
// a session's current stable alias ("nux") but drops a rebinding pool-slot alias
// and every prior alias in alias_history; an agent that claimed work under one
// of those holds it under an identifier the narrow set cannot see, so a narrow
// probe would report "no assigned work" for a busy agent and authorize killing it.
//
// The drain-ack CLOSE gate deliberately does NOT adopt this wide set. A
// transient pool SLOT alias ("gascity/gc.run-operator-1") is a rebinding chair
// rather than an owner, and no guard may honor one, or a rebind lets a fresh
// session shield or inherit a dead session's claim (#4981/#5241, pinned by
// TestAssignmentGuardsIgnoreTransientPoolSlotAliases). The two gates can differ
// because their errors are not symmetric: over-refusing a KILL leaves a row
// wedged exactly as it is today, while over-honoring ownership at the CLOSE
// keeps dead rows open forever. Erring wide belongs in front of the kill only.

// drainAckForceTerminationTargets selects, from the scan hits for a session, the
// processes that are actually THAT SEAT'S RUNTIME — and reports how many hits it
// refused.
//
// This is the load-bearing fence, and it exists because matching on
// GC_SESSION_ID + GC_CITY_PATH proves ENV INHERITANCE, not runtime ownership.
// Both are ordinary environment variables inherited by every child of the
// agent's shell, and proctable promotes any such process to an "agent root" as
// soon as its parent is gone (ppid <= 1), excluding only tmux. So the naive
// match sweeps in every long-lived process an agent ever backgrounded:
//
//   - the managed-Dolt SCOPE WATCHDOG, which is re-exec'd with Setpgid and the
//     agent's environment verbatim; its SIGTERM handler kills the city's SHARED
//     dolt sql-server, i.e. the beads store for the controller and every other
//     agent in that city;
//   - a detached supervisor from `gc start` / `gc supervisor start`, likewise
//     Setpgid and env-inheriting, whose process group spans every city on the box.
//
// And TerminateRuntime signals the process GROUP (kill(-pid, ...)), so hitting
// one of those does not cost one process, it costs the group.
//
// The removed IsTracked guard was doing this job by accident: the tmux scanner
// keys tracked-ness by SESSION ID, so it marks every root carrying a live
// session's ID as tracked, and the pre-existing callers skip all of them. The
// five session-level fences re-authorize the SESSION; only this one re-supplies
// the PER-PROCESS attribution.
//
// The discriminator is PARENTAGE. A pane the provider still owns has the
// provider's server as its parent; a backgrounded daemon leads its own group
// and, once its spawner exits, is adopted by a subreaper.
//
// It is stated POSITIVELY — the parent must be provider infrastructure — rather
// than as "the parent is not a subreaper", because the negative form cannot be
// made to fail closed. Recognizing a reparent destination means knowing which
// pid is the child subreaper, and that is NOT always pid 1: under a
// user@UID.service, `systemd --user` sets PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER, so orphans
// reparent to the USER MANAGER and carry a large LIVE ppid. The user manager's
// pid can only be DETECTED, by walking a parent chain — and the chain available
// here is the CONTROLLER's, used as a proxy for the target's. When the two
// diverge (a controller restarted from an ssh shell or a system unit while the
// tmux server descends from the user manager) detection returns nothing, every
// `ppid <= 1` style test reads the orphaned watchdog as a live owned child, and
// its process group — whose SIGTERM handler stops the city's shared dolt
// sql-server — becomes a kill target. runtime.LiveRuntime.ParentIsProviderInfrastructure
// has no such dependency: the scan sets it only where it positively read the
// parent's command name and matched tmux infrastructure, so an unreadable
// parent, an unreported ppid, and an unrecognized parent all REFUSE. Read that
// for exactly what it is — a command-name match, which accepts any tmux process
// on this host, not a socket-scoped test against this provider's own server.
// It is still the discrimination this fence needs, because the orphan
// topologies above reparent to pid 1 or to the user manager, and neither of
// those names tmux.
//
// pidutil.IsReparentedOrphan is kept alongside it, both because it names the two
// known orphan topologies precisely in the journal and because a fence this
// consequential should not rest on a single predicate. Process-NAME matching is
// deliberately not used as a test: the agent process is frequently a DESCENDANT
// of the runtime root rather than the root itself (a pane's foreground can be a
// wrapper), so requiring the root's name to match the agent's process hints
// would refuse the legitimate target.
//
// The cost of the positive form is that a provider whose runtimes are not
// children of infrastructure the scan recognizes gets no force at all — its rows
// stay exactly as wedged as they are today. That is the right direction for this
// file's whole error budget: over-refusing a kill costs a wedged row, while
// under-refusing one costs a shared dolt server.
