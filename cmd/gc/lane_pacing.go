// startPacedLane starts a background lane goroutine and returns a channel
// closed when it exits (ctx done). pass runs one pass; wake reports whether a
// wake, rather than the backstop, triggered it.
//
// Two rules pace the lane, both measured from the end of the previous pass:
//
//   - Duty cycle. A wake starts a pass at once if the lane has been idle at
//     least as long as its previous pass ran (and at least minWakeGap).
//     Otherwise the wake waits until it has, and every wake in that wait
//     (including one that lands mid-pass) joins the one pass that follows.
//     The lane is therefore busy at most half the time while a pass fits in
//     the interval (a longer pass is followed by one interval idle), never
//     runs two passes back to back, and a lane with short passes keeps the
//     wake source's latency.
//   - Backstop. One timer, reset at the end of every pass, runs a pass one
//     interval after the previous pass ended if nothing else has. A wake never
//     waits longer than the backstop would.
//
// A free-running ticker would add passes on its own grid; a wake that ignored
// the duty cycle would run passes back to back.
