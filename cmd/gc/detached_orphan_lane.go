// The detached-handoff-orphan lane: events for freshness, a cadenced scan for
// convergence — the third application of the split route recovery and the
// completions reconcile already run.
//
// # What was wrong
//
// sweepDetachedHandoffOrphans repairs a work bead whose failed done sequence
// cleared assignee and gc.routed_to together, leaving it invisible to pool
// demand. That is a CONVERGENCE repair of a rare failure, and it was wired to
// run at DELTA cadence: a cache-bypassing full live open-corpus scan of the city
// work ledger AND every rig store, serially, on every controller tick.
//
// On maintainer-city that leg measured 180.8s of a 373s tick — 48.5% — dead
// constant across ticks with restored_count=0 on every one (ga-l7jdg, post-S1/S2
// profile). The variance is the tell, the same tell as its sibling: a fixed-size
// scan of a corpus that does not change.
//
// The in-code note that "in steady state there are no candidates, so the
// expensive session-index lookup is skipped entirely" is true and misses the
// cost. The session-index lookup is skipped; the Live open scan that FINDS the
// candidates is not, and that scan is the whole leg.
//
// route_recovery.go:71 already said the two were kin ("Mirrors
// sweepDetachedHandoffOrphans"). This is that treatment, applied.
//
// # The split
//
//   - The DELTA pass runs in the tick. Its candidates are the beads the journal
//     named whose snapshot carries the detached-orphan signature, and nothing
//     else. A steady tick names nothing, builds no plan, and issues no read.
//   - The BACKSTOP pass is the old scan, unchanged in what it repairs, demoted to
//     a background lane on an hourly cadence — plus, immediately, on every way
//     the event feed can lie: startup, a cursor gap, a watcher that could not
//     start or restarted, a candidate overflow, and a leg that errored last pass.
//
// Unlike its route-recovery sibling there is no SYNCHRONOUS startup scan. The
// sibling has one because ga-n2d.4's restart-recovery contract is a startup
// backstop on the readiness path; this scan has no such contract and is the
// 180.8s leg, so putting it on the boot path would trade a tick cost for a boot
// cost. The startup pass runs on the background lane instead, within one poll
// interval of the feed being armed.
//
// # Two things the pre-lane sweep could not reach, and now does
//
// The old sweep took the city store plus the rig store map. On a converged split
// city that set does not include the class binding, so a binding-resident orphan
// had no lane at all. The backstop plans over storeref.RoutedWork on the
// reconcile plane, which reads every leg INCLUDING the binding — the plane
// doctrine's asymmetry (planeReadsLeg): the runtime plane narrows for latency,
// the reconcile plane never narrows, because a leg it skips is a leg nothing
// converges.
//
// It also rebuilt the session route index once per scope. The index is now built
// at most once per pass, lazily, and only when a candidate survives its live
// re-check — so the ordinary pass that finds nothing pays for nothing.
