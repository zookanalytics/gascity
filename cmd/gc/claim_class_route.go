package main

// Claim-time write routing by coordination class.
//
// `gc hook --claim` issues every claim-time write through
// beads.NewBdStore(dir, ...) — a bd subprocess rooted in the agent's WORK
// directory (hookClaimBdStoreContext). A relocated coordination class is not a
// bd workspace and cannot be expressed as a hookStore{dir, env} at all, so on a
// split city those writes run against a ledger that cannot see the bead.
//
// The read half closed first: the generated work query now reads through the
// federated `gc ready`, which covers the binding in process (ga-bvdha). That
// made relocated graph work VISIBLE to the worker without making it claimable —
// an assigned graph step was re-served and re-skipped every tick and no worker
// ever ran it. This file is the write half. It adds a CLASS axis to the existing
// hookClaimOps seam, alongside the rig axis in claim_cross_store.go, rather than
// a parallel claim path.
//
// # The order is EVERY work leg first, and that is not the by-id order
//
// A claim is a WRITE, so the store is found by PROBE — ask which store holds the
// bead — never by routing unconditionally on an id prefix. `gc storage migrate`
// preserves ids (infra_class_migrate.go), so a relocated bead keeps its
// HQ/rig-era prefix and a prefix route would miss exactly the beads that moved;
// the same reason bdByIDClassDoor.resolve probes residence.
//
// What differs from the by-id door is the ORDER of the probe, and the difference
// is load-bearing on the one id a probe order can disagree about: a CO-RESIDENT
// bead, which is the documented steady state of a migrated city because the
// migration copies and never deletes back.
//
//   - storeref.ClassCandidates and bdByIDClassDoor lead with the class store.
//     Their caller holds only an id.
//   - `gc ready` — the federated reader that produced this claim's candidate —
//     leads with the CITY work store and runs the graph leg LAST, so a
//     co-resident id resolves to the work store's row (#5148/#5158/#5161,
//     ready_federation.go).
//
// The claim must agree with the reader that served it, and the failure if it
// does not is not cosmetic: claiming the class copy while the reader keeps
// answering from the still-open work copy re-serves the same bead every tick,
// which is the treadmill this slice exists to end.
//
// "The work store" is a PLURAL, and reading it as a singular is how the order
// above stops being true. The claim runs against one leg of a fan-out
// (hookWorkQueryStores), and for the rig-scoped agents that are the shipped
// shape of every worker that claims, the city work store is the leg that runs
// LAST: the rig store is prepended as the primary and appendCityHookStore
// appends the city store at the end. So the not-found the FIRST-selected leg
// returns proves only that THAT leg does not hold the bead — the city work leg
// behind it may.
//
// The escalation is therefore a property of the whole fan-out, not of one leg.
// Before a not-found opens it, every OTHER leg is READ for the same id
// (anotherWorkLegHolds), and a leg that holds the bead closes it: the work
// store's answer stands, the federated loop drops the leg that could not resolve
// it, and the leg that holds it claims it on the next turn of the same
// invocation — at its own rank, not behind whatever else the fan-out is
// carrying. Co-residence therefore keeps the WORK copy on any leg that holds it,
// byte-identically to today.
//
// A read rather than a second pass, because a second pass would let unrelated
// lower-tier work in another leg be claimed first, which is the starvation this
// slice closes wearing a different hat. The reads are bounded — one per
// remaining leg, once per id, only for a bead the leg that answered could not
// resolve — and claimHookWorkWithRunner is what hands the route the leg set
// (hookClaimOps.ClassRoute).
//
// # The escalation signal is the existing one, unwidened
//
// beads.ErrNotFound is the ONLY error that proves the bead is not in the store
// the write ran against (hookClaimBeadIsElsewhere), and it opens the escalation
// only together with ok=false. A write timeout, store contention or a
// controller-socket flap leaves ownership unresolved on a bead the session may
// already own, and must keep failing closed — so those are returned unchanged
// and never retried against a second store. This file consumes that predicate;
// it does not widen it.
//
// ok=true is the same refusal for the same reason. hookClaimThroughStore returns
// (claimed, true, err) for exactly one shape — the CAS COMMITTED and the
// canonical readback then failed — and BdStore.Get produces an
// ErrNotFound-wrapping error for a plain miss, an empty result AND
// beads.ErrIDCollision, so that readback failure routinely satisfies the
// predicate on a claim that landed. Escalating it would claim one logical bead
// in two ledgers and swallow the signal both call sites stop on, so the
// committed claim is returned exactly as the work store reported it.
//
// A read failure from the binding is likewise an error and never absence:
// reading "the binding could not answer" as "the bead is not there" is the
// root-loss shape this whole lane exists to prevent. The one error that is not a
// fault is the one-shot funnel's standing refusal, handled exactly as
// classRoutedStoreForID handles it.
//
// # A binding that cannot claim is a city fact, not a bead fault
//
// The CAS the routed claim acquires through is a capability: *beads.SQLiteStore
// has the two-argument Claim and the other compiled-in binding provider's engine
// (beadsworkspace over *beads.NativeDoltStore) does not, so the closed contract
// answers ErrBeadsAdapterCapability rather than emulating it. That is a standing
// property of the city's storage configuration, so it is refused at the DOOR —
// newHookClaimClassRoute verifies it once, the way storebinding's
// NewBeadsNudgeQueue verifies the same capability at construction — and
// claimHookWork then runs unrouted with one loud line rather than failing every
// claim of every bead in every store.
//
// If a refusal reaches a claim anyway, it is a per-BEAD skip and not a terminal
// tick: the escalation only ran because a work store returned not-found, which
// proves this session owns nothing there and that no mutation is outstanding
// anywhere (the capability refusal is returned before any write). That is the
// same proof the work-side not-found carries, so it earns the same skip —
// hookClaimBindingRefusedTheClaim, kept separate so the work-side predicate
// stays exactly as narrow as it was.
//
// # A single-store city takes none of this
//
// hookClaimClassRouteForCity gates on cliSoleClassBinding — store identity, the
// same question resolveClassStore asks — and returns nil for a city that
// relocates nothing. classRoutedHookClaimOps then returns the ops value it was
// handed, unwrapped, so every claim-time write is the exact call it is today.
