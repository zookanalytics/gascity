// poolSlotDrainRetireDeadline bounds how long a pool-managed session bead may
// sit in an unfinalized drain before the reconciler retires it outright.
//
// Why a bound is needed at all: a session bead that enters drain and never
// finalizes stays status=open forever, and an open session bead owns its
// session_name and occupies its pool slot. The pool cannot route around it:
// a tmux_alias slot's runtime name is a pure function of its identity, and an
// unaliased slot's bead-scoped successor is only minted once the open row
// releases the slot (ga-vcjr9 — minting a second box beside a live one leaks a
// runtime nothing will ever address again). It drops to ZERO seats and every
// bead routed to that template becomes unclaimable. Production ran that way for
// 3d10h (ga-rxhu2).
//
// Ordering, load-bearing: this deadline must stay well ABOVE the drain-ack
// deadline cycle and strandedRepairConfirmGrace (session_beads.go) so the
// ordinary drain path always finalizes first and this bound only ever sees
// seats that machinery has already given up on. A healthy drain completes in
// seconds to minutes; the measured pathology is hours to days. Do not lower
// this below the drain-ack cycle without re-reading both.
const poolSlotDrainRetireDeadline = 30 * time.Minute

// drainFinalizeMetadataKey records HOW a drain reached its terminal close. It
// is absent on the ordinary path (the drain finalized on its own) and set to
// drainFinalizeDeadline when the bound below forced the retirement, so forced
// retirements are greppable in the store as well as countable on the event bus:
//
//	bd list --closed --json | jq 'select(.metadata.drain_finalize=="deadline")'
//
// It is stamped just before the close and CLEARED again if that close is
// refused, so the marker and the counted event never disagree — a seat whose
// forced close was refused and which later finalizes through the ordinary path
// must not close carrying deadline provenance it did not earn.

// sessionInUnfinalizedDrain reports whether info is still parked in the drain
// that began at drainAt — as opposed to a seat that drained once, came back,
// and is working normally with a stale marker.
//
// Two independent discriminators, because the obvious one is not enough. The
// reconciler re-heals a drained bead whose runtime is still alive back to
// state=awake (healStatePatchWithRollbackInfo → ProjectLifecycle), so by the
// second tick the stuck seat no longer reads as drained in its state at all.
// What survives that heal is sleep_reason=drained and an empty last_woke_at:
// every drain-completion patch (AcknowledgeDrainPatch, SleepPatch,
// CompleteDrainPatch) clears last_woke_at, and only a real wake re-stamps it.
//
// So: a wake at or after drainAt ended the drain, and an unparseable wake
// marker fails closed. Beyond that the bead must still carry drain provenance,
// which excludes the live seat whose drain was CANCELED (scale-back-up) and
// which therefore kept its pre-drain last_woke_at and lost its sleep_reason.
//
// state=draining is deliberately NOT matched, and the premise for that is
// narrower than it first looks. BeginDrainPatch is the sole writer of both
// state=draining and drain_at, but it has TWO callers, not one:
// DrainAckStopPendingPatch, whose rows reconcileDrainAckStopPending intercepts
// and continues before this gate, and the exported session.Manager.BeginDrain,
// which has no production caller today (only tests). So the real premise is
// "drain_at is stamped on the controller's drain-ack path", and it holds by
// call-graph accident rather than by invariant: wiring an operator-facing drain
// to Manager.BeginDrain would widen this bound's population with nothing
// failing. That is why gate 1 (poolSlotRetireOwnsSeat) enforces the identity
// and state exclusions instead of arguing them from reachability.
//
// The drain-ack population converges through its own machinery when its runtime
// is killable (measured: 3 ticks); when the runtime is NOT killable it stays

// resolves no config agent, so for a seat that merely left the desired set
// while its agent is STILL configured the legacy-manual exclusion in
// poolSlotRetireOwnsSeat does degrade to a no-op — but gate 1's marker-less

// either way and only the check doing the refusing differs. Separately, for a
// seat that IS retired while absent from desiredState, both emitted events
// would name an empty template, one of the two fields the payload doc names for
// reading the age distribution per pool.

// admits — raw-empty session_origin, slot-shaped name, multi-session agent —
// reaches its agent only through info.Template, and an empty template would
// send it to the marker-less refusal instead of freeing the slot name it
// squats. That population is "undesired and pre-backfill", so it is exactly the
// population this fallback exists for.
//
// It cannot recover the case where the agent itself left config, because then

// poolSlotRetireOwnsSeat is gate 1: whether this bound may act on info's seat

//
// Identity. isPoolManagedSessionInfo is satisfied by session_origin=ephemeral
// ALONE, and that is exactly the shape the repo's own
// isLegacyManualSessionInfoForAgent defines as a legacy USER-created seat
// (ephemeral origin, no pool_managed, no pool_slot — sessions persisted before
// the manual-origin backfill). So the pool predicate by itself does not deliver
// "a named or manual session's identity is not disposable". The sibling
// pool-freeable close pairs the same predicate with !isNamedSessionInfo; this
// path needs the manual exclusion too, and needs it more, because it answers
// with a Kill of a LIVE runtime rather than a close over an already-dead one.
//
// Attribution. That exclusion is only as good as the pool it resolves. Narrow
// the population to what can still reach this point — admitted by the pool
// predicate, already past the named check, and carrying NO positive pool marker
// — and three of isLegacyManualSessionInfoForAgent's bail-out clauses are dead
// by construction (named, pool_managed, pool_slot). Four stay live, and a seat
// slips the legacy arm on any one of them: a nil agent; an agent that resolves
// but is not multi-session (no namepool and max_active_sessions=1 — see
// config.Agent.SupportsMultipleSessions); info.DependencyOnly; and a raw
// info.SessionOrigin that is not "ephemeral".
//
// That last one is live because admission never required a STAMPED origin.
// sessionOriginInfo DERIVES "ephemeral" from a raw-empty origin — on
// DependencyOnly alone, or on a slot-shaped session name via resolvePoolSlot —
// while the legacy predicate tests the raw field. It also fires FIRST, ahead of
// the DependencyOnly clause, so for this file's own dependency-only fixture,
// which deliberately stamps no session_origin, the origin bail-out is what
// slips the legacy arm rather than that final clause.
//
// The refusal below covers three of those four shapes: nil agent,
// single-session agent, and dependency-only. The first two collapse into a
// single term because SupportsMultipleSessions is false on a nil receiver; the
// third is a separate OR because a dependency-only seat's agent need not be
// single-session, and ANDing the terms would leave exactly that seat admitted.
// The fourth shape stays deliberately ADMITTED: a raw-empty-origin seat with a
// slot-shaped name under a multi-session agent is squatting a pool slot name,
// which is the exact contention this bound exists to free.
//
// The condition is not "no agent resolves" — it is "no agent resolves a POOL".
// An unattributable seat cannot be proven disposable either way, and a
// dependency-only one holds no pool slot at all (sessionOriginInfo calls it
// ephemeral on DependencyOnly alone, with no marker required), so retiring it
// would free nothing this bound exists to free while still killing a live
// runtime. Multi-session capability arrives here as a side effect of reusing
// the legacy predicate's own semantics: it is a MIGRATION-eligibility condition
// upstream, so the refusal mirrors it rather than importing it as a
// disposability test in its own right.
//
// The refusal stays narrowed to seats carrying NO positive pool marker, because
// a pool_managed/pool_slot seat whose agent left config is exactly the stuck
// population this bound exists to retire — failing closed on it would turn the
// gate into a feature-off switch. Markers are written by this reconciler;
// ephemeral origin alone is not.
//
// Every refusal here is deliberately silent: this is a pure predicate over
// every session on every tick, so a log line belongs with the gate's other
// observability rather than inside it. When the bound never fires on a seat you
// expected it to free, read pool_managed/pool_slot on the bead first — their
// absence is the precondition for the refusal above, and a marker-bearing seat
// never reaches it.
//
// State. This gate runs ABOVE the reconciler's !isKnownStateInfo skip, and
// sessionInUnfinalizedDrain's sleep_reason arm matches without consulting state
// at all — so without this check an older reconciler rolled back under a newer
// writer could kill and close a bead parked in a state it has never seen, which
// is precisely the population that skip exists to leave alone. The precedent
// that also acts pre-skip (reconcileDrainAckStopPending) matches one exact
// state it owns outright; this path matches a provenance marker, so it is the
// first pre-skip handler that can fire on a state it has never seen and it must
// respect the allowlist itself. Both shapes this bound targets — drained, and
// the awake ghost the heal decays it into — are in knownSessionStates, so
// nothing in scope is lost. draining is NOT in that set (it is exactly the
// forward-compat example the skip's own comment names), which makes the

//     that resolves and is multi-session, and not a dependency-only seat) unless
//     it carries this reconciler's own markers, and in a state this reconciler
//     recognizes. A human-owned identity is not disposable, an unattributable
//     one cannot be shown to be otherwise, a dependency-only one holds no slot
//     to free, nothing about any of them can starve a pool to zero seats, and a
//     state written by a newer version belongs to the forward-compat skip below
//     this call site, not to this path.
//  2. Not a degraded tick. A partial store enumeration cannot prove a seat is
//     idle, and the boot tick defers session closes because this exact
//     per-candidate multi-store fan-out is what #3288 moved off the readiness
//     path. Every other close in this loop honors both; so does this one.
//  3. No advisory hold (poolSlotRetireBlocker).
//  4. Past the deadline, in a drain that never finalized.
//  5. No assigned work under ANY of the seat's identities — checked BEFORE
//     anything touches the runtime, and AGAIN immediately before the kill,
//     because the first probe walks every residency leg and a seat healed back
//     to awake is an ordinary live seat to anything that routes work. Claims
//     that outlive their session are a different defect (ga-ee8eo).
//  6. The runtime is proven absent, or stopped and then re-observed gone. A
//     stop whose result is unknown does not authorize a close: closing over a
//     surviving agent produces a live runtime that no bead owns, which is
//     strictly worse than the stalled slot it would replace.
//  7. A final work fence immediately before the write, because the stop itself
//     takes time.
//
// Every failure is fail-closed: a degraded store read or a degraded runtime
// observation proves nothing, so the seat keeps its bead and the next tick
// re-decides.
