// licenses that reuse is a fingerprint over the stores the demand probe reads.

// converged split city, where every routed graph step lives — and the
// fingerprint did not hash it. A step claimed or closed there changed nothing
// the fingerprint could see, so the controller kept asserting demand for work
// that was already taken.

// from a DIFFERENT store than the work store, the way a converged split city
