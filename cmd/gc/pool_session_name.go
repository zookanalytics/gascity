// tests bead status, not runtime liveness. Each lane defers to the others and

// deliberately takes no liveness argument and performs no liveness probe: the

// no longer lives there, so the routed fallback asks a store that answers "no
// such bead" and the release is silently skipped (ga-b0o6a). An absent slice
// (nil or empty) keeps the routed fallback, so callers that supply nothing are
// unchanged. A non-empty slice of any other length is a DIFFERENT snapshot, not
// a smaller one: in-range beads are still resolved through it, and out-of-range
// beads are skipped entirely rather than routed-fallback resolved. Callers must
// reject a misaligned slice before calling — see reconcileSessionBeads, which

//     verb it slots in inside BdStore.ReleaseIfCurrent (feature-detect the
//     verb, fall back to `bd sql` on unsupported) and this caller needs no
//     change.
//  2. Otherwise the tightest conditional path the store layer offers:
//     beads.UpdateOpts has no conditional fields, so re-verify the snapshot
//     with a live read immediately before the unconditional write and re-read
//     after it, logging loudly when a concurrent claim raced the release. The
//     residual recheck->write window cannot be closed without a store-level
//     conditional write; it is shrunk and made observable instead of silent.
