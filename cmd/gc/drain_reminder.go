// The drain reminder: a stop nobody was ever asked to make.
//
// A drain-acked session is moved to the durable stop-pending state and its
// runtime is stopped asynchronously. When that stop does not take — the pane
// survives the signal, the process reparents, the provider refuses — the row
// stays `state=draining, state_reason=drain-ack-stop-pending` with a LIVE
// runtime, and the controller re-queues the same stop on every tick, forever.
// Nothing in that loop ever tells the AGENT anything. It cannot: the drain
// signal is metadata, learned by polling, and the session this happens to is
// the one sitting idle at its prompt not polling anything.
//
// So the loop has no exit but an operator killing the pane. This pass adds the
// one thing missing from it: ask the agent. It runs off the same durable row
// state the re-examination already reads, in the bounded shape the two nudge
// backstops use (observe, remind, back off, give up), and it is purely
// informational — it never stops anything.
//
// # It is anchored on the ROW, not on the drain tracker
//
// The in-memory drainTracker is the wrong anchor and an earlier revision of
// this file proved it: a tracked drain is tracker-resident for about two
// advances before the stop-pending handover clears it, the whole tracked phase
// is bounded by defaultDrainTimeout, and a controller restart drops the tracker
// entirely. The wedged rows — the ones that sit for days — have no tracker
// entry at all. Everything here therefore keys off the session bead and the
// durable stop-pending state, which are exactly what survives.
//
// # The reminder carries the identity because the pane's environment may not
//
// `gc runtime drain-ack` with no argument binds the acknowledgement through the
// caller's own GC_SESSION_ID/GC_INSTANCE_TOKEN. An adopted pane whose
// environment did not survive a restart therefore acks as nobody, which reads
// downstream as no acknowledgement at all. The reminder text names the session
// id so the agent runs the explicit-argument form, which resolves the target
// from the store instead of from the pane.
//
// # Idleness comes from the runtime, not from a cache
//
// The quiet test reads the provider's activity signal directly (raw tmux window
// activity on the tmux provider), never the observation cache: on an idle pane
// that cache can read hours fresher than tmux does (ga-gg4mv), which would hold
// the reminder forever on exactly the sessions it exists for. An unreadable
// signal HOLDS rather than proceeds — the #312 rule that "we cannot tell" is
// never "idle".
//
// Known bounded exposure: the k8s and ssh providers' GetLastActivity shell
// `tmux display-message -p '#{session_activity}'` inside the pod, and
// session-level activity does not advance on pane I/O for a detached session
// (see Tmux.rawSessionActivity, which queries per-window activity for exactly
// this reason). A busy k8s agent therefore reads as idle-since-attach and can
// be nudged mid-turn. The ssh provider has the same exposure for the same
// reason (internal/runtime/ssh/provider.go reads #{session_activity} and
// reports CanReportActivity: true). Every other provider is fail-closed. The
// exposure is capped at drainReminderMaxAttempts informational nudges per drain
// and is tracked as its own fix rather than papered over here.
