// Storage-class routing at boot: registry → effective config → plan → verdict
// → routes.
//
// This is the one place a controller process decides where each coordination
// class is served from, and it decides it once. The registry is built and
// frozen here, the plan is resolved here, the convergence verdict is taken
// here, and the opened engine is held here for the life of the process. Live
// storage handles are immutable, so a config reload that changes [storage]
// refuses the whole reload rather than re-entering this file — the check is
// config.StorageReloadRequiresRestart, wired in CityRuntime.reloadConfigTraced.
//
// # No config is a bypass, not an equivalent path
//
// A city with no [storage] section short-circuits at the top of the gate,
// before a registry is constructed, before a plan is resolved, and before a
// single byte is read from a binding root. Routes are nil, every class resolver
// stays the identity it is today, and the compatibility claim is therefore true
// by construction rather than by an equivalence argument over two code paths
// that happen to agree. TestStorageGateBypassesEverythingWithoutConfig pins it.
//
// The bypass asks exactly one question first, and the question is not about
// configuration: has this city ever served its infrastructure classes from a
// binding? That is one read of one path in the city's own .gc, absent on every
// city the compatibility contract was written for, and it costs them a failed
// open and nothing else — no registry, no plan, no binding root. It is here
// because without it the deletion of the [storage] section was the one edit
// that walked past every hold in this file, and the refusals were arranged so
// that an operator trying to undo a split would find it.
//
// Always resolving the default plan was the alternative and was rejected: plan
// resolution takes pinned Work inputs whose drift checks are a refusal mode,
// and a city that never authored [storage] must not gain one.
//
// # Boot refuses; it never migrates
//
// The verdict this gate takes is three-valued in effect: serve, bypass, or
// refuse. There is no fourth arm that fixes anything. A city whose config names
// a binding it has not converged on is a city whose infrastructure state is
// somewhere other than where its readers are about to look, and the only safe
// thing a booting binary can do about that is stop and say so — with the name
// of the command that performs the move. See infra_class_migrate.go for why the
// copy cannot be on this path.
