// The reconciler frame's census legs, resolved through internal/storeref.
//
// One question — "which stores does a controller-tick sweep read?" — asked once,
// for the session-iteration arm, the assigned-work arm and the unassigned-routed
// arm. Before this they shared coordClassStoreCandidates, which built the list
// from cfg alone and could name only two families: the store it was handed, and
// the configured rigs. It had no way to name a relocated class binding, so the
// binding reached the census only by being the store the caller HANDED it.
//
// # The E2 dual role, and why naming both legs is the whole slice
//
// buildDesiredState hands the census its SESSIONS-class store, which on a
// converged split IS the binding. So the census covered the binding by accident,
// as its "city" leg — and the city WORK store, which rigBeadStores() explicitly
// deletes, was then in no leg at all. A city-scope routed WORK bead was
// invisible to controller-tick demand: the pool never spawned for it, and a dead
// claim on one was captured and released by nothing (D6, ga-88mxz;
// split_topology_conformance_test.go pre-declared the flip rows for both halves).
//
// Plan(Census) names work AND the rigs AND every binding as DISTINCT ref'd legs,
// which is exactly the shape that was missing. The work leg comes from the
// runtime's own registration rather than from the store the arm was handed,
// because the store it was handed is the one that used to stand in for it.
//
// # The suspension frame is threaded, not re-derived
//
// A suspended rig is routinely dark, and Plan marks a dark FederationTail leg's
// failure PartialDegrade — which means retain-don't-reap. Left in, one suspended
// rig would mark every census Partial and pin the fleet against every drain and
// reap decision. The serving set is therefore computed by the caller that
// already knows it and handed in: told, not deciding.

//
// Two things make it a different question from censusStoreCandidates rather
// than a cheaper version of it.
//
// The INTENT is RoutedWork, which is the surface `gc ready` and the hook claim
// through. Sharing it is the reader-agreement property (internal/storeref's
// TestSweepAndDemandReadTheSameStores): a bead the controller counts as demand
// must be a bead a worker can claim, and the fastest way to break that is for
// one of them to resolve its own leg list.
//
// The PLANE is runtime, and it narrows to the bindings because the operator
// ruling is that routed work lives only in the graph store — "gc ready work will
// never be in the work db" (ga-4qdfn) — so the ledger leg this arm used to read
// SEQUENTIALLY, once per census leg, could not hold the answer. It was 8.1s of a
// 24.2s demand leg on maintainer-city.
//
// The narrowing is the resolver's, not this file's: storeref.Narrow keeps the
// plan's order, roles and per-leg error policies and only drops legs, so a
// consumer cannot accidentally answer the latency question by reordering the
// plan (#5148 co-residence — binding-LAST is deliberate).
//
// A city that relocates nothing narrows to its one work store, which there IS
// its infra store.

// It is NOT routedWorkStoreCandidates. That one narrows to the runtime plane
// (the bindings) on the ruling that routed work never lives in the work ledger;
// `gc sling` and formula dispatch stamp gc.routed_to on work-class beads that do
// live there, and `gc ready` — the reader a seat claims through — federates the
// unnarrowed plan and serves them. A count that skips the ledger leg is a
// claimable bead counted by nobody, so the pool never spawns for it (#6019).

// binding resolves to the ledger's row here exactly as it does on the claim side.
