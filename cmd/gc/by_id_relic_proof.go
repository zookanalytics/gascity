// The by-id door's relic proof: computed, never recorded.
//
// A city whose boot REFUSED still serves WORK from its work ledger, so the
// residency resolver tolerates the standing storage refusal on a residence
// probe and the surface falls through to its own axis. The sentence that
// justifies that is "this leg was only ever a probe for an id no relocated
// class could own", and there is exactly one shape of city it is false for: one
// whose binding still holds ids `gc storage migrate` carried across under their
// original work-shaped names. There, falling through does not land on "no
// answer" — it lands on the frozen pre-migration copy the migration left in the
// work store, which answers confidently and wrongly, and the close that follows
// writes it. That is ga-q8ick.
//
// # Why the proof is taken here rather than read off disk
//
// The obvious place to keep this verdict is a note under the city's own .gc,
// written by whichever process last managed to read the binding. It is the
// wrong place twice over. It is a status file, which this codebase does not
// keep (AGENTS.md: no status files — query live state), and it could not
// replace the census anyway: a note is only as good as the process that wrote
// it, so it is absent on every city no such process has visited, and the read
// below has to exist for those cities regardless.
//
// The premise the note was there to work around turns out to be false anyway.
// "Refused" is a verdict about SERVING the binding — a convergence check, a
// served-binding note, a discipline the boot gate enforces — and almost none of
// those verdicts say the binding cannot be READ. So the census that decides
// this runs right here, against a handle opened for the read and closed after
// it, and its answer is about the binding as it is now.
//
// # What it costs, and who pays
//
// Only a refused city reaches any of it. residencyTopologyForCity has already
// answered by the time the gate below is consulted, and a served city's
// Topology.Refused is nil, so it resolves no plan, opens no engine and takes no
// read — TestServedCityPaysNothingForTheRelicProof counts the plan resolutions
// and requires zero. A refused city pays one engine open and one full list of
// the binding, on the by-id path only. That city is already in the incident
// state its own boot gate reported.
//
// The memo below makes that ONE read per city for the callers this door
// actually has: one-shot cobra commands that resolve by-id sequentially. It is
// not a single-flight — provenRelicRefsForCity releases the memo lock across
// the census — so two concurrent by-id callers on the same refused city would
// each take the read, and each would open its own handle on the binding root.
// That is the second-handle hazard named below, and what rules it out today is
// the absence of such a caller, not the memo. A parallel by-id caller has to
// bring a single-flight (or a sync.Once entry) with it: ga-nzxob.
//
// # Who the denial reaches
//
// The proof is keyed by BINDING ref, not by id, so what turns Fatal is the
// whole binding's residence probe: every non-reserved by-id read on this city's
// CLI fallback path denies, including a fresh post-migration work bead and a
// rig-shadowed id that can have no frozen twin at all. That breadth is a
// deliberate choice rather than a forced one: the census enumerates closed
// relics as well as open ones, so a per-id rule would have the population it
// has to consult, and the corpus pins the binding-keyed breadth —
// residency_conformance_test.go's T3k rows make ByID(ga-xyz) and ByID(ra-7)
// Fatal too, not just the reserved-prefix ones. The operator cost is that one
// proven relic takes the by-id door away for the city, not only for the ids
// the migration preserved.
//
// # The absent case is the tolerant one
//
// Every way of not reaching an answer — a config that will not load, a plan
// that will not resolve, a provider that opens no engine, an open that fails —
// is proof-ABSENT, and proof-absent falls through exactly as today. The bit
// only ever denies, so its unknown must be false: a binding nobody could read
// has proved nothing, and denying on it would take work-bead reads away from
// every city whose binding is merely unreachable.
//
// # It opens only a binding that ALREADY EXISTS on disk
//
// beads.OpenSQLiteStore creates the database when it is absent, so an opener
// used as a probe answers its own question: it would report "no relics" about a
// binding it just created. The never-migrated city — a [storage] split
// configured and never cut over — is the most common refused city there is, and
// on it an ordinary by-id read would leave an empty binding root behind that a
// later boot reads as a genesis root. A workspace-backed provider would start a
// managed engine for the same read. So existence is checked BEFORE the open,
// through the same two helpers the migration's own no-open probe uses
// (infraBindingRootEnumerable, infraPathExists), and a binding that is not
// already there is proof-absent.

// The root is checked as well as the database, and for this gate that is
