// The completions lane: the same events-for-freshness / scan-for-convergence
// split the route-recovery lane runs, applied to graph.v2 completion facts.
//
// # What was wrong
//
// A controller can crash between a durable graph-step close and the best-effort
// `execution.step_completed` journal append, and graph stores intentionally emit
// no bead.closed at all — so a missed close would be a permanent lifecycle gap
// with nothing to repair it. ReconcileCompletedStores is that repair, and it is
// a convergence backstop: it re-derives the whole truth from current state.
//
// It was gated on `trigger == "patrol"`, which is not a cadence. Under overload
// every ticker fire that survives coalescing IS a patrol trigger, so the gate
// degraded to "every tick", and the pass walked every workflow root ever created
// — closed ones included, a corpus that only grows — on each one. 72.4s +/- 0.9s
// of a ~360s tick, constant, which is exactly the signature of a fixed corpus
// (ga-l7jdg, measured on ga-4qdfn).
//
// # The split
//
//   - The tick runs the DELTA pass: the roots the journal named since the last
//     pass, and nothing else. Roots are named by an execution.step_* fact's RunID
//     and by a bead.closed step snapshot's gc.root_bead_id. A steady tick names
//     none and reads neither the stores nor the journal.
//   - The full pass becomes a background sweep, chunked and resumable so a corpus
//     bigger than one chunk cannot starve its own convergence, plus the startup
//     pass that was already there.
//
// Trigger-name gating is gone on purpose. Explicit cadence state is the in-tree
// shape (wisp_gc.shouldRun, orderRescanInterval); "patrol" meaning "always" under
// load is precisely how this backstop ended up hot.
