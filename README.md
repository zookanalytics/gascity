# Gas City

Gas City is an orchestration-builder SDK for multi-agent systems. It extracts
the reusable infrastructure from Gas Town into a configurable toolkit with
runtime providers, work routing, formulas, orders, health patrol, and a
declarative city configuration.

## Coming from Gas Town?

Start with [Coming from Gas Town?](docs/getting-started/coming-from-gastown.md).
It maps Town roles, commands, plugins, convoys, and directory habits onto Gas
City's primitive-first model so experienced Gas Town users can ramp without
trying to port the entire Town architecture literally.

## What You Get

- Declarative city configuration in `city.toml`
- Multiple runtime providers: tmux, subprocess, exec, ACP, and Kubernetes
- Beads-backed work tracking, formulas, molecules, waits, and mail
- A controller/supervisor loop that reconciles desired state to running state
- Packs, overrides, and rig-scoped orchestration for multi-project setups

## Quickstart

See the full install guide at [docs/getting-started/installation.md](docs/getting-started/installation.md).

### Prerequisites

Gas City requires the following tools on your system. `gc init` and
`gc start` check for these automatically and report any that are missing.

| Dependency | Required | Min Version | Install (macOS) | Install (Linux) |
|------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| tmux | Always | — | `brew install tmux` | `apt install tmux` |
| git | Always | — | `brew install git` | `apt install git` |
| jq | Always | — | `brew install jq` | `apt install jq` |
| pgrep | Always | — | (included in macOS) | `apt install procps` |
| lsof | Always | — | (included in macOS) | `apt install lsof` |
| dolt | Beads provider `bd` | 1.86.1 | `brew install dolt` | [releases](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases) |
| bd | Beads provider `bd` | 1.0.0 | [releases](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/releases) | [releases](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/releases) |
| flock | Beads provider `bd` | — | `brew install flock` | `apt install util-linux` |
| claude / codex / gemini | Per provider | — | See provider docs | See provider docs |

The `bd` (beads) provider is the default. To use a file-based store instead
(no dolt/bd/flock needed), set `GC_BEADS=file` or add `[beads] provider = "file"`
to your `city.toml`.

Install from Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gastownhall/gascity/gascity
gc version
```

Or build from source (requires `make` and Go 1.25+):

```bash
make install

gc init ~/bright-lights
cd ~/bright-lights
gc start

mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
git init
gc rig add .

bd create "Create a script that prints hello world"
gc session attach mayor
```
