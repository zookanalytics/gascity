//go:build integration

// Package corpus loads the shared dashboard e2e fixture corpus
// (test/dashport/testdata/dashport) into an in-memory seeded city that both the
// Go serve-level integration test (Layer A, test/dashport) and the browser
// render smoke's fake supervisor (Layer B, test/dashport/cmd/fakesupervisor)
// serve. It is the ONE source of truth for the seeded scenario: a single
// scenario is asserted at both the projection level (Go) and the pixel level
// (Playwright) with no drift.
//
// The loader takes no *testing.T and returns (fixtures, error) so a main
// package can import it. The build tag keeps it out of the production binary
// and the normal integration-test surface; it compiles only under -tags
// integration, mirroring api.ServeSeededCity.
