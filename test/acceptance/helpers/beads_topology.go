// The init topology matrix.
//
// Gas City supports more than one way to bring a beads scope up, and the
// proxied-local default is only the newest of them. This file describes each
// supported shape once — how to initialize it, what must end up on disk, which
// processes must exist and who owns them — so a test can walk all of them
// instead of proving the default and hoping the rest still work.
//
// The shapes are AC-M of the beads-proxied-local-default design:
//
//	M1 proxied-local      the default: bd's proxy plus its own Dolt child
//	M2 direct-local       bd's own server-mode Dolt, no proxy
//	M3 direct-external    a Dolt server somebody else runs, reached directly.
//	                      Two front doors: the legacy --dolt-host alias (no
//	                      journal, canonical city endpoint) and the
//	                      transport/target selector (provider-owned).
//	M4 proxied-external   a local bd proxy fronting that external server
//	M5 legacy GC-managed  the pre-journal shape: gc runs the sql-server itself
//	M6 doltlite           the embedded engine; no Dolt process at all
//	M7 deferred           GC_DOLT=skip at init; gc start finishes the store
//
// M5 cannot be created by the gc under test — every fresh `gc init` journals
// its scope as provider-owned — so it is initialized with the gc binary named
// by GC_ACCEPTANCE_LEGACY_GC_BIN and driven with the new one from there on.

// ProcessOwner names who is expected to own a Dolt-family process.

// reliably complete:
//
// gc's bd pack pre-creates the city's Dolt database with CREATE DATABASE and
// pre-seeds a metadata stub, so the `bd init` it then runs takes the
// `--force`/`--reinit-local` arm against a database that exists and is empty.
// That arm bounds its schema migration at five seconds. A full migration to the
// current schema takes about thirty seconds on a loaded box, so it stops
// partway (v36 through v46 observed), and the next open sees a half-migrated
// database and is refused by bd's own #5920 shared-store gate with "This
// workspace was NOT created".
//
// The bound is what makes it look like something changed: the identical
// binaries were green on an idle box, where the whole migration fits inside the
// five seconds. It reproduces without gc — `bd init --server` against a fresh
// database takes ~30s and reaches the current schema, `bd init --server
// --force` against an empty one is pinned at ~5.5s and does not — and
// identically on every v1.3.0 release candidate and on the v1.3.0 tag.
//
// It covers the whole legacy shape, not just the one `gc init` the old binary
// runs: `gc rig add` under the binary being tested creates the rig's database
// on the same gc-managed server, through the same pack, and takes the same arm.
