	// ONE write(2) per invocation, not one per field.
	//
	// O_APPEND makes a single write atomic; it does not make a block of them
	// atomic, and the block this used to be issued one write per printf —
	// strace confirms N+2 of them for an N-argument fork. Two bd forks in
	// flight (the daemon's reconciler cascade plus an operator command, or a
	// provider `health` racing an in-process call) therefore interleaved their
	// fields, and Invocations() read the result as one record with a foreign
	// ppid spliced into its argv plus one empty record — so Count() silently
	// under-reported by one, exactly when the city was doing real work. The
	// deterministic fork gate the next slice builds on Count() cannot stand on
	// that.
	//
	// The record is assembled in a variable and emitted with ONE printf. What
	// that buys is bounded by the shell's stdout buffer, not by PIPE_BUF, and
	// this used to claim otherwise. Measured with strace on a 20 000-byte
	// record:
	//
	//   - /bin/dash: one write(1, …, 20000) for the record plus a SEPARATE
	//     write of the trailing newline (measured: one write up to 8000 bytes,
	//     two from 8200 on). The record is never split, so dash cannot splice;
	//     but because the newline is its own write, a concurrent fork's record
	//     can land between a record and its newline, and the log then carries
	//     two newlines in a row. Invocations() treats every leading newline as
	//     belonging to no record, so that shape parses as the two intact
	//     records it is.
	//   - /bin/bash standing in as /bin/sh (Fedora, macOS): five writes in
	//     4096-byte chunks. Two concurrent forks whose argv exceeds 4 KiB can
	//     interleave chunks there.
	//
	// gc does build argv over 4 KiB — bead bodies ride `--description`
	// (internal/beads/bdstore.go) — so that is an ordinary size, not an exotic
	// one. The limitation is therefore stated rather than papered over, and
	// Invocations() refuses to guess when it meets an interleaved record instead
	// of quietly under-counting. A per-invocation file would remove the bound
	// altogether; it would also cost a directory scan per assertion, which is
	// the trade PR2's deterministic gate can make if it ever runs where /bin/sh
	// is bash.
	//
	// The separators are literal bytes rather than printf escapes so that
	// assembling a record costs no subshell: a fork per invocation inside the
	// instrument would be a process the fork census cannot see.
	//
	// The bytes on disk are unchanged (ppid US arg US … US RS newline), so
	// Invocations parses exactly what it parsed before.
