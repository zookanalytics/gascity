// SentinelDolt is a PATH-first `dolt` that records who ran it and then execs the
// real one.
//
// It exists for one assertion that cannot be made any other way: gc must never
// spawn a Dolt server for a scope bd owns. That claim is made in gc's source by
// omission — the proxied open window sets BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_MODE with
// BEADS_DOLT_AUTO_START=0 and withholds the whole BEADS_/BD_ namespace around the
// open — and an assertion about an omission is exactly the kind that passes for
// the wrong reason. A process that is never started leaves no trace to look for,
// so "we found no trace" is equally true of a correct gc, a gc whose spawn failed
// for an unrelated reason, and a test that was looking in the wrong place.
//
// What makes the assertion falsifiable is that the same instrument records the
// dolt processes that ARE legitimately spawned: bd's proxy starts one (that is
// the whole topology), and gc itself runs `dolt version` from a doctor check. So
// the sentinel can be shown to see gc's dolt children AND to see sql-server
// spawns, and the claim becomes the intersection of the two being empty rather
// than an absence of evidence.
//
// The recording is a side effect of a real run: the shim execs the pinned dolt,
// so the city behaves exactly as it would without it.
//
// It has a second mode for the one place a pass-through instrument would be a
// hazard: an open of the linked library in the TEST's own process (see
// TrapThisProcess). There the sentinel records and REFUSES, so the control
// that proves the library's auto-start reaches it cannot start a Dolt server,
// and a regression in the fence it watches cannot either.

	// On Linux the parent is read from /proc with a redirect rather than a `cat`,
