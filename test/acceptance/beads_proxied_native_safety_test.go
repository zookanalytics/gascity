//go:build acceptance_a

// The proxied-native lane's safety rows.
//
// P2-14 measures what the lane makes cheaper; P2-15 measures how it behaves when
// the proxy moves. This file is about the two things that would make the lane
// unshippable however fast it is:
//
//	gc must never spawn a Dolt server for a scope bd owns, and
//	gc must never let the linked library migrate a database bd owns.
//
// Both are claims about something NOT happening, which is the hardest kind of
// claim to test honestly: a process that was never started leaves no trace, so
// "no trace found" is equally true of a correct gc and of a test looking in the
// wrong place. Each row here is therefore paired with a positive control — an
// instrument shown to record the thing it is claiming the absence of — and the
// assertion is the intersection of two observations rather than the absence of
// one.
//
// The third row is a forward pin rather than a safety property: beads latches
// GIT_AUTHOR_NAME/EMAIL onto the store instance AT OPEN, so the author of every
// Dolt commit a proxied-window handle ever makes is decided by the env map PR2
// projects. PR2 writes nothing through that handle on any product path, which is
// exactly why the pin has to exist now: PR3's authorship is already determined by
// code that has landed, and a beads bump that moved that read would otherwise
// surface as mis-attributed commits in PR3 rather than as a failure here.

		// beads reads GIT_AUTHOR_NAME/GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL in applyConfigDefaults at
		// OPEN (v1.3.0 internal/storage/dolt/store.go:1430,:1449,:1455), latches
		// them onto the store instance (:1974-1975), and commitAuthorString
		// (:3170) is what feeds DOLT_COMMIT(..., '--author', ?). So the author of
		// every commit a proxied-window handle will ever make is decided by the
		// env map PR2 projects — a map PR2 itself never writes through.
		//
		// The pin is therefore in two halves, and both are needed:
		//
		//   - cmd/gc's TestProxiedOpenEnvForPinGolden asserts the exact map
		//     production projects, including the author pair;
		//   - this row opens the library over a real proxy with that map's shape
		//     and asserts the Dolt commit that comes out carries `gc <gc@city>`.
		//
		// It opens the store directly rather than through a gc command because
		// there is no product path that writes through a proxied window in PR2 —
		// which is exactly why the pin cannot wait for one.
		//
		// And it opens the BARE storage through the proxied window, not
		// OpenNativeDoltStoreAtProxied (round3 review, completeness). Every
		// handle that function returns is read-only latched, structurally
		// (council B-F5), so a Create through it is refused before it reaches
		// the library and this row could only fail. OpenNativeStorageAtProxied
		// is the same window — the same BEADS_/BD_ withholding, the same
		// projection of this env map, the same library open that latches the
		// author — so the author the library commits with is decided exactly
		// as it is for the read handle. The write goes through gc's own
		// NativeDoltStore.Create over that storage, built with the exported
		// test constructor, because a writable proxied handle is PR3's to ask
		// for by name (WithProxiedWritable) and PR2 must not ship one.
